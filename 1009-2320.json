The rest is not yet history as Gary Johnson, a former governor of New Mexico, seeks a seat in the U.S. Senate as a Libertarian and political wild card.\n\nJohnson says his high-desert home state of 2 million residents stands to gain considerable influence in the Senate if he is elected as a freewheeling swing vote -- possibly a decisive vote in the chamber, as Republicans defend a slim 51-49 majority in November elections.\n\nDemocrats are being forced to defend what had seemed like a secure seat for incumbent first-term Sen. Martin Heinrich, fending off Johnson's allure among voters as an uncompromising fiscal conservative with a quirky brand of free-market, pro-cannabis policies.\n\n\"Arguably if elected I would be the swing vote in the U.S. Senate, and that would be a big yank for New Mexico. It should benefit New Mexico in a really big way,\" Johnson tells a crowd of two dozen at a candidate forum in Tucumcari, near a string of abandoned highway-side motels, on the state's rural eastern plains.\n\nNationwide, Democrats are defending 26 incumbent Senate seats, while Republicans are defending only nine. The stakes in fall Senate races have been on dramatic display in Supreme Court confirmation proceedings amid accusations of sexual misconduct against nominee Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nJohnson says he would be a voice of common sense in the Senate and a rare nonpartisan vote during Supreme Court confirmation proceedings -- and an impartial judge in the event of a Senate impeachment trial against President Donald Trump, though he sees no impeachable offense so far.\n\nUntil then, Johnson applauds Trump's work at diminishing regulations, and denounces White House immigration policies as shameful and bad for the economy.\n\nThe real political crisis and looming threat to America's wellbeing, Johnson says, is runaway deficit spending. And the day of reckoning will come, according to Johnson, in the form of Venezuela-style inflation if the U.S. continues to spend beyond its means, on military and social programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.\n\n\"I applaud Trump on the tax cuts, but where is the spending reduction to go along with that,\" said Johnson, who wants to join the Senate Budget Committee that sets out Congress' broad blueprint for levels of federal revenues and spending.\n\nProminent Democrats say Johnson can't barge his way onto the committee, and they suspect he would readily collaborate to torpedo federal health care and nutritional subsidies that New Mexico relies on heavily.\n\nDede Feldman, a Democratic political strategist who served in the state Senate when Johnson was governor, questions Johnson's credentials as a voice of moderation, noting he was held in contempt as governor by the New Mexico Supreme Court for persisting with aggressive welfare changes without legislative approval.\n\nAt a community bank in Tucumcari, Johnson finds a receptive audience for his criticism of burdensome federal financial regulation in a meeting with the board of directors -- and some astonishment at his calls to decrease military spending by 23 percent, cut Medicare and retool Social Security.\n\n\"I'm 80 years old. I'm on Medicare, I receive Social Security, and I'm retired from the military,\" said Bill Curry, a board member at the Tucumcari Federal Savings and Loan Association, which was founded during the 1930s Great Depression. \"You've hit me on four different things.\"\n\nJohnson doesn't back down, cautioning social and retirement programs won't be around for future generations without prompt action.\n\nHe derides as a budget-buster his opponent Heinrich's support of \"Medicare-for-all\" legislation aimed at making strides toward universal health insurance coverage.\n\nHeinrich has cast himself as a defender of federal health and retirement benefits, and proponent of the new outdoor-recreation and renewable-energy economies -- a progressive hedge in an oil-based state economy.\n\nHeinrich, with youthful looks at age 46, has turned his committee appointments, including Armed Services, into a venue for expedient constituent politics in support of the New Mexico's military facilities and veterans.\n\nJohnson's answer to escalating medical costs is less regulation and even easing licensing requirement for medical professionals. His faith in free-market solutions with less regulation spills over into everything from oilfield methane emissions to public education, where Johnson supports government spending on independent schools through vouchers.\n\nPollsters and analysts see obstacles to Johnson building a quick coalition, after his late entry to the race in August.\n\n\"There are a lot of unaffiliated registered voters, but they tend to vote in half their numbers on low-turnout elections,\" said pollster Brian Sanderoff, of Research & Polling in Albuquerque. \"They're less likely to vote in nonpresidential election cycles.\"\n\nNew Mexico's Republican Party is calling Johnson a spoiler, saying he will draw votes from their candidate -- construction contractor and political newcomer Mick Rich -- playing directly into Democrats' hands.\n\nJohnson dismisses the GOP as a lost cause this year in New Mexico, which sided with Hillary Clinton in 2016 by a wide margin and twice backed Barack Obama.\n\n\"I do not think that a Republican can win a statewide race in New Mexico. I think that Trump has polluted those chances,\" he said.\n\nAs a Republican governor, Johnson vetoed more than 700 bills in perpetual standoffs with a Legislature run by Democrats, vetoing the entire budget in his final year only to have legislators override him. His advocacy as governor for marijuana legalization, beginning in 1999 when the stance was unpopular, still provides a political calling card -- one that Johnson says speaks to his honesty regardless of political consequences.\n\nCampaign disclosure filings show Johnson also is an investor in the nascent legal marijuana sector and a professional adviser to a cannabis hedge fund. He is a recreational user himself -- in a state that regulates medical marijuana access but still penalizes recreational cannabis.\n\nHeinrich, the Democrat, recently threw his support behind legalizing marijuana, while Johnson already is contemplating how to provide pardons for legions of drug-possession convicts.\n\nFor Johnson, a third act in politics at age 65 would mean setting aside a lifestyle of 100-day winter ski seasons and summer endurance bicycle rallies along the Continental Divide. Barnstorming through tiny towns to shake hands and deliver yard signs, Johnson said Trump has created the perfect storm for a Libertarian or truly independent candidate to join Congress and broker majority votes -- calling Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Angus King of Maine independents in name only.\n\nStopping unannounced at a barbecue stand at midday, Johnson ignites flickers of recognition and then conversations that often turn to his thoughts on cannabis.\n\n\"I love his policies,\" said Jace Alderson, 61, of Moriarty, recalling Johnson's hard-line stance against government spending as a Republican governor. \"It doesn't matter what party he is.\"","source":{"uri":"wral.com","dataType":"news","title":"WRAL.com"},"authors":[],"eventUri":null,"location":{"type":"place","label":{"eng":"Tucumcari, New Mexico"},"lat":35.17191,"long":-103.72686,"country":{"type":"country","label":{"eng":"United States"},"lat":39.76,"long":-98.5}}},{"uri":"965790356","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2018-10-10","time":"05:19:00","dateTime":"2018-10-10T05:19:00Z","dataType":"news","sim":0.6901960968971252,"url":"https://www.eurweb.com/2018/10/antonio-brown-sued-for-throwing-furniture-from-balcony-that-nearly-killed-toddler/","title":"Antonio Brown Sued for Throwing Furniture From Balcony That Nearly Killed Toddler","body":"According to TMZ, Brown snapped back in April and threw a bunch of furniture off the balcony of his 14th story luxury apartment, and some of it shattered near a 22-month-old baby.\n\nA lawsuit obtained by TMZ Sports states Antonio is being sued by Ophir Sternberg -- who claims it was his toddler son who was walking around the pool at the apartment complex with his grandfather when suddenly \"large objects started to fall from the building many floors above them.\"\n\nOTHER NEWS YOU MIGHT HAVE MISSED: Kanye West and Donald Trump Have a Lunch Date at the White House\n\nSternberg claims the items included: 2 very large vases, a heavy ottoman and other pieces of furniture.

Around midday it was expected to become one of the Panhandle's worst hurricanes in memory with 125 mph winds and a life-threatening storm surge of up to 13 feet (4 meters).\n\nFlorida officials said roughly 375,000 people up and down the Gulf Coast had been urged or ordered to evacuate. Evacuations spanned 22 counties from the Florida Panhandle into north central Florida. But fears lingered that some failed to heed the calls to get out of Michael's way as the hard-charging storm began speeding north over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nWorried meteorologists said it had the potential of becoming one of the worst storms in the history of Florida's Panhandle.\n\n\"I guess it's the worst case scenario. I don't think anyone would have experienced this in the Panhandle,\" meteorologist Ryan Maue of weathermodels.com told The Associated Press. \"This is going to have structure damaging winds along the coast and hurricane force winds inland.\"\n\nUniversity of Georgia's Marshall Shepherd, a former president of the American Meteorological Society, called it a \"life-altering event\" on Facebook and said he watched the storm's growth on satellite images with a pit growing in his stomach.\n\nFranklin County Sheriff A.J. Smith near the vulnerable coast said his deputies had gone door to door in some places urging people to evacuate. \"We have done everything we can as far as getting the word out,\" Smith said. \"Hopefully more people will leave.\"\n\nOn the exposed coast of Florida's Big Bend, most of the waterfront homes in Keaton Beach stood vacant amid fears of a life-threatening storm surge in an area that hadn't seen a potentially catastrophic major hurricane in decades. Even so, 77-year-old resident Robert Sadousky wasn't quite ready to evacuate yet.\n\nThe retired mill worker has spent more than half his life on the coast and weathered his share of storms. He chose the spot where his house stands on tall stilts overlooking the Gulf waters in 1972 after it was the only lot left dry after a storm flooded the beach that year.\n\nWhile most homes around him are vacation rentals or summer getaways for their owners, Sadousky had stayed put through more than four decades of storms. No longer. Michael was expected to bring surging seas up 9 feet (2.75 meters) above ground level at Keaton Beach.\n\n\"I know it's going to cover everything around here,\" Sadousky said Tuesday, eyeing water lapping at the edge of a canal behind his home. He pulled two small boat docks from the water, packed his pickup and picked some beans from his garden before getting out -- like hundreds of thousands elsewhere.\n\nAt 11 p.m. Tuesday, the eye of Michael was about 220 miles (355 kilometers) south-southwest of Panama City, Florida. It also was about 200 miles (325 kilometers) south-southwest of Apalachicola, Florida. But forecasters said winds and outer rain bands of a storm that was strengthening and becoming better organized by the hour would begin lashing the coast well ahead of the eye making landfall.\n\nMore than 180,000 people of those leaving were under mandatory evacuation orders, the long lines of cars jamming routes out Tuesday.\n\n\"We don't know if it's going to wipe out our house or not,\" Jason McDonald, of Panama City, said as he and his wife drove north to safety into Alabama with their two children, ages 5 and 7. \"We want to get them out of the way.\"\n\nFlorida Gov. Rick Scott warned it was a \"monstrous hurricane,\" and his Democratic opponent for the Senate, Sen. Bill Nelson, said a \"wall of water\" could cause destruction along the Panhandle.\n\n\"Don't think that you can ride this out if you're in a low-lying area,\" Nelson said on CNN.\n\nBut some officials were worried by what they weren't seeing -- a rush of evacuees.\n\n\"I am not seeing the level of traffic on the roadways that I would expect when we've called for the evacuation of 75 percent of this county,\" Bay County Sheriff Tommy Ford said.\n\nIn the dangerously exposed coastal town of Apalachicola, population 2,500, Sally Crown planned to go home and hunker down with her two dogs.\n\n\"We've been through this before,\" she said. \"This might be really bad and serious. But in my experience, it's always blown way out of proportion.\"\n\nMandatory evacuation orders went into effect in Panama City Beach and other low-lying areas in the storm's path. That included Pensacola Beach but not in Pensacola itself, a city of about 54,000.\n\nMichael could dump up to a foot (30 centimeters) of rain over some Panhandle communities before its remnants go back out to sea by way of the mid-Atlantic states over the next few days. Forecasters said it also could bring 3 to 6 inches of rain to Georgia, the Carolinas and Virginia, triggering flash flooding in a corner of the country still recovering from Florence. And isolated tornadoes were also possible.\n\nLush reported from St. Petersburg, Florida.

Sorbe said the meeting was a valuable opportunity for Senate members to share their ideas with students involved in student government at other schools in the state.\n\n\"I think student federation is a good time for collaboration for student government associations across the state and to shoot ideas off of each other that we may be having and complications we might be having,\" Sorbe said. \"They are good people to bounce ideas off of because they are doing the same things we are doing just in different places.\"\n\nThe Board of Regents meeting covered a variety of topics including need-based financial aid, faculty salary competitiveness, Native American student enrollment and free speech policy revisions.\n\nSorbe said he found the first reading of the free speech policy an interesting point of discussion.\n\n\"They saw their first reading and it was approved to their second one where the Regents will most likely vote on the policy in December,\" Sorbe said. \"Outside of that, we also met South Dakota student federation out at Mines and there we discussed the Board of Regents priorities, which will be introduced in resolution from USD to student federation for all their agendas.\"\n\nSorbe and Green attended the meeting on behalf of USD, while the rest of the senators went on a volunteer basis. The Board of Regents meets every two months.\n\nSkunk said attending this meeting gave him an appreciation for USD's SGA.\n\n\"We should take pride in what we have as far as student government goes,\" Skunk said. \"If you look at the student federations at the School of Mines, their office is one room. We are very lucky here.\"\n\nAt this week's SGA meeting, the Senate relooked at five bills and one resolution. Three of the five bills were passed at this meeting. Senate Bill 78, which appropriates the budget for the Seldinger Society, Senate Bill 79, which approves the budget for the Philosophy club and Senate Bill 80 which appropriates the Math Club budget.\n\nThe other two bills, Senate Bill 76, which poses to change the SGA election dates and Senate Bill 77, which is on student organization recognition, will be brought back after going to internal reviews for the next meeting.\n\nSenate Resolution 6, which poses to change the MUC hours back to 2 a.m., was discussed and voted on, but it did not pass. Besides the discussion for this resolution, special guest Dan Dailey, Dean of Libraries, also addressed the Muenster University Center hours.\n\nDailey distributed a document of facts for the Senate to look at while he spoke. According to the document, I.D. Weeks Library originally began staying open till 2 a.m. in 2010. The dean of libraries and staff reviewed the policy again in 2014 and saw that there was the low utilization of the library, but decided to keep the policy as is.\n\nBefore the hour's change was made this school year, there was a thorough review of the current hours. Data was collected on the number of student present after midnight along with the use of computers after midnight.\n\n\"A very small fraction of those entries into I.D. Weeks happen after midnight during the weeknights,\" Daily said. \"I asked our staff to look at the utilization of I.D. Weeks after midnight, we dug into the statistics in 2017 and 2018.

Well, he's in that space again because the man who says he was assaulted by Williams last Friday in Portland is suing the funnyman for $76,000.\n\nHis lawyer says the money is for his physical injuries and emotional distress. The alleged victim's name is Wali Kanani and he's the owner of Delta Town Car Service in Portland.\n\nKanani was picking up Williams, his German Shepherd, and his colleagues at a private hanger of the airport, reports Fox12.\n\nThe complaint, filed Monday, states Williams insisted his dog sit in the front seat, and Kanani said no.\n\nThe document outlines what happened from there. It alleges Williams called Kanani names like \"white trash,\" then punched him in the face.\n\nKanani ran inside to get away and Williams reportedly \"commanded his dog to start chasing\" him, according to court documents.\n\n\"This is totally inappropriate behavior and there has to be some sort of deterrent effect above and beyond what the lawsuit itself would bring,\" Kanani's attorney Adam Heder said.\n\nThat's why Heder filed the complaint now asking for $76,000 plus medical costs.\n\nREAD THIS/BLIND ITEM: HIS 'GIRLFRIEND' IS PRETTY MUCH AN AFTERTHOUGHT\n\nThe article goes on to say that Attorney Heder wouldn't provide photos of Kanani's injuries, but said he had cuts and swelling on his face, a broken tooth and tinnitus in one ear, as well as what he's suffered emotionally.\n\n\"You can imagine in the course of doing your job getting struck in the face in this aggressive and belligerent manner can cause a tremendous amount of emotional distress to even the best of us,\" Heder said.\n\nAs far as what's happening with Williams in court, on Monday he had a hearing on the charge of assault in the fourth degree.

Dall'Imis al fondo perequativo, dai nidi al trasporto pubblico, in assenza di informazioni abbiamo dovuto confermare i numeri dell'anno scorso\".\n\nLa proposta di bilancio completa sarà depositata il 15 novembre, un mese prima della discussione in aula.\n\nCome avviene ormai da svariati anni, tutti i Servizi comunali sono stati invitati a ridurre la spesa corrente e a calibrare bene le previsioni, in modo da non generare avanzo. Per quanto riguarda i contenuti della manovra, il sindaco ha sottolineato l'invarianza delle tariffe (\"al massimo ci sarà un adeguamento al tasso di inflazione programmata\"), l'aumento delle risorse per i lavori socialmente utili e per il turismo: \"E' un settore che tira - ha spiegato Andreatta - Quest'anno poi è andato particolarmente bene grazie alla concentrazione di grandi eventi ospitati in città\".\n\nMassima attenzione anche al sociale, con l'aumento (costante in questi anni) delle voci per l'integrazione dell'affitto e per supportare le famiglie più fragili. Naturalmente in primo piano resta anche il capitolo sicurezza, che prevede tra l'altro la sostituzione di tutti gli agenti che andranno in pensione e il rafforzamento della squadra aggiuntiva della polizia municipale, che diventa stabile e non più a termine come ai suoi esordi.\n\nTra i temi del confronto, pure il bando Periferie e il nodo dei 18 milioni di euro prima confermati e poi messi in dubbio dal governo nazionale: \"Pare che i fondi non ci siano stati tolti, ma siano stati posticipati al 2020 - ha spiegato l'assessore Gilmozzi - Se le risorse non arrivassero, ai Comuni è stata data la possibilità di utilizzare l'avanzo di bilancio. Non che la cosa ci faccia piacere, perché l'avanzo sono soldi nostri, non dello Stato\".\n\nL'assessore Gilmozzi si è soffermato anche sugli investimenti dei prossimi anni: dal restyling di piazza della Mostra alla nuova piscina, dal recupero dell'ex Atesina a quello dell'ex facoltà di Lettere, dal nuovo quartiere in viale dei Tigli ai numerosi interventi di manutenzione sul patrimonio edilizio esistente.\n\nI sindacati hanno invitato l'Amministrazione comunale a mantenere alta l'attenzione sulla sicurezza e sulla percezione della sicurezza da parte dei cittadini (Pomini) e sulle politiche di conciliazione per favorire il lavoro delle donne (Grosselli). Alotti ha sollecitato il sindaco ad aumentare la tassazione sulle case sfitte. E ancora Grosselli ha chiesto di mirare non solo alla riduzione dei costi ma anche alla tutela del lavoro negli appalti di servizi.","source":{"uri":"lavocedeltrentino.it","dataType":"news","title":"La Voce del Trentino Quotidiano online INDIPENDENTE"},"authors":[],"eventUri":null,"location":null},{"uri":"965790374","lang":"ita","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2018-10-10","time":"05:19:00","dateTime":"2018-10-10T05:19:00Z","dataType":"news","sim":0,"url":"https://www.lavocedeltrentino.it/2018/10/10/concluso-nel-migliore-dei-modi-lo-street-food-festival-levento-che-unisce-la-comunita-e-colora-le-strade/","title":"Concluso nel migliore dei modi lo Street Food Festival, l'evento che unisce la comunità e colora le strade - La voce del Trentino","body":"Si è conclusa domenica la terza edizione dello Street Food Festival, l'evento ha colorato le strade della città che, come sempre, sono state riempite dai profumi più disparati ed intriganti.\n\nSolo qualche giorno fa è stato celebrato un altro importante appuntamento, il Mercato Europeo.

The rest is not yet history as Gary Johnson, a former governor of New Mexico, seeks a seat in the U.S. Senate as a Libertarian and political wild card.\n\nJohnson says his high-desert home state of 2 million residents stands to gain considerable influence in the Senate if he is elected as a freewheeling swing vote -- possibly a decisive vote in the chamber, as Republicans defend a slim 51-49 majority in November elections.\n\nDemocrats are being forced to defend what had seemed like a secure seat for incumbent first-term Sen. Martin Heinrich, fending off Johnson's allure among voters as an uncompromising fiscal conservative with a quirky brand of free-market, pro-cannabis policies.\n\n\"Arguably if elected I would be the swing vote in the U.S. Senate, and that would be a big yank for New Mexico. It should benefit New Mexico in a really big way,\" Johnson tells a crowd of two dozen at a candidate forum in Tucumcari, near a string of abandoned highway-side motels, on the state's rural eastern plains.\n\nNationwide, Democrats are defending 26 incumbent Senate seats, while Republicans are defending only nine. The stakes in fall Senate races have been on dramatic display in Supreme Court confirmation proceedings amid accusations of sexual misconduct against nominee Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nJohnson says he would be a voice of common sense in the Senate and a rare nonpartisan vote during Supreme Court confirmation proceedings -- and an impartial judge in the event of a Senate impeachment trial against President Donald Trump, though he sees no impeachable offense so far.\n\nUntil then, Johnson applauds Trump's work at diminishing regulations, and denounces White House immigration policies as shameful and bad for the economy.\n\nThe real political crisis and looming threat to America's wellbeing, Johnson says, is runaway deficit spending. And the day of reckoning will come, according to Johnson, in the form of Venezuela-style inflation if the U.S. continues to spend beyond its means, on military and social programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.\n\n\"I applaud Trump on the tax cuts, but where is the spending reduction to go along with that,\" said Johnson, who wants to join the Senate Budget Committee that sets out Congress' broad blueprint for levels of federal revenues and spending.\n\nProminent Democrats say Johnson can't barge his way onto the committee, and they suspect he would readily collaborate to torpedo federal health care and nutritional subsidies that New Mexico relies on heavily.\n\nDede Feldman, a Democratic political strategist who served in the state Senate when Johnson was governor, questions Johnson's credentials as a voice of moderation, noting he was held in contempt as governor by the New Mexico Supreme Court for persisting with aggressive welfare changes without legislative approval.\n\nAt a community bank in Tucumcari, Johnson finds a receptive audience for his criticism of burdensome federal financial regulation in a meeting with the board of directors -- and some astonishment at his calls to decrease military spending by 23 percent, cut Medicare and retool Social Security.\n\n\"I'm 80 years old. I'm on Medicare, I receive Social Security, and I'm retired from the military,\" said Bill Curry, a board member at the Tucumcari Federal Savings and Loan Association, which was founded during the 1930s Great Depression. \"You've hit me on four different things.\"\n\nJohnson doesn't back down, cautioning social and retirement programs won't be around for future generations without prompt action.\n\nHe derides as a budget-buster his opponent Heinrich's support of \"Medicare-for-all\" legislation aimed at making strides toward universal health insurance coverage.\n\nHeinrich has cast himself as a defender of federal health and retirement benefits, and proponent of the new outdoor-recreation and renewable-energy economies -- a progressive hedge in an oil-based state economy.\n\nHeinrich, with youthful looks at age 46, has turned his committee appointments, including Armed Services, into a venue for expedient constituent politics in support of the New Mexico's military facilities and veterans.\n\nJohnson's answer to escalating medical costs is less regulation and even easing licensing requirement for medical professionals. His faith in free-market solutions with less regulation spills over into everything from oilfield methane emissions to public education, where Johnson supports government spending on independent schools through vouchers.\n\nPollsters and analysts see obstacles to Johnson building a quick coalition, after his late entry to the race in August.\n\n\"There are a lot of unaffiliated registered voters, but they tend to vote in half their numbers on low-turnout elections,\" said pollster Brian Sanderoff, of Research & Polling in Albuquerque. \"They're less likely to vote in nonpresidential election cycles.\"\n\nNew Mexico's Republican Party is calling Johnson a spoiler, saying he will draw votes from their candidate -- construction contractor and political newcomer Mick Rich -- playing directly into Democrats' hands.\n\nJohnson dismisses the GOP as a lost cause this year in New Mexico, which sided with Hillary Clinton in 2016 by a wide margin and twice backed Barack Obama.\n\n\"I do not think that a Republican can win a statewide race in New Mexico. I think that Trump has polluted those chances,\" he said.\n\nAs a Republican governor, Johnson vetoed more than 700 bills in perpetual standoffs with a Legislature run by Democrats, vetoing the entire budget in his final year only to have legislators override him. His advocacy as governor for marijuana legalization, beginning in 1999 when the stance was unpopular, still provides a political calling card -- one that Johnson says speaks to his honesty regardless of political consequences.\n\nCampaign disclosure filings show Johnson also is an investor in the nascent legal marijuana sector and a professional adviser to a cannabis hedge fund. He is a recreational user himself -- in a state that regulates medical marijuana access but still penalizes recreational cannabis.\n\nHeinrich, the Democrat, recently threw his support behind legalizing marijuana, while Johnson already is contemplating how to provide pardons for legions of drug-possession convicts.\n\nFor Johnson, a third act in politics at age 65 would mean setting aside a lifestyle of 100-day winter ski seasons and summer endurance bicycle rallies along the Continental Divide. Barnstorming through tiny towns to shake hands and deliver yard signs, Johnson said Trump has created the perfect storm for a Libertarian or truly independent candidate to join Congress and broker majority votes -- calling Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Angus King of Maine independents in name only.\n\nStopping unannounced at a barbecue stand at midday, Johnson ignites flickers of recognition and then conversations that often turn to his thoughts on cannabis.\n\n\"I love his policies,\" said Jace Alderson, 61, of Moriarty, recalling Johnson's hard-line stance against government spending as a Republican governor. \"It doesn't matter what party he is.\"","source":{"uri":"wral.com","dataType":"news","title":"WRAL.com"},"authors":[],"eventUri":null,"location":{"type":"place","label":{"eng":"Tucumcari, New Mexico"},"lat":35.17191,"long":-103.72686,"country":{"type":"country","label":{"eng":"United States"},"lat":39.76,"long":-98.5}}},{"uri":"965790356","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2018-10-10","time":"05:19:00","dateTime":"2018-10-10T05:19:00Z","dataType":"news","sim":0.6901960968971252,"url":"https://www.eurweb.com/2018/10/antonio-brown-sued-for-throwing-furniture-from-balcony-that-nearly-killed-toddler/","title":"Antonio Brown Sued for Throwing Furniture From Balcony That Nearly Killed Toddler","body":"According to TMZ, Brown snapped back in April and threw a bunch of furniture off the balcony of his 14th story luxury apartment, and some of it shattered near a 22-month-old baby.\n\nA lawsuit obtained by TMZ Sports states Antonio is being sued by Ophir Sternberg -- who claims it was his toddler son who was walking around the pool at the apartment complex with his grandfather when suddenly \"large objects started to fall from the building many floors above them.\"\n\nOTHER NEWS YOU MIGHT HAVE MISSED: Kanye West and Donald Trump Have a Lunch Date at the White House\n\nSternberg claims the items included: 2 very large vases, a heavy ottoman and other pieces of furniture.

Around midday it was expected to become one of the Panhandle's worst hurricanes in memory with 125 mph winds and a life-threatening storm surge of up to 13 feet (4 meters).\n\nFlorida officials said roughly 375,000 people up and down the Gulf Coast had been urged or ordered to evacuate. Evacuations spanned 22 counties from the Florida Panhandle into north central Florida. But fears lingered that some failed to heed the calls to get out of Michael's way as the hard-charging storm began speeding north over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nWorried meteorologists said it had the potential of becoming one of the worst storms in the history of Florida's Panhandle.\n\n\"I guess it's the worst case scenario. I don't think anyone would have experienced this in the Panhandle,\" meteorologist Ryan Maue of weathermodels.com told The Associated Press. \"This is going to have structure damaging winds along the coast and hurricane force winds inland.\"\n\nUniversity of Georgia's Marshall Shepherd, a former president of the American Meteorological Society, called it a \"life-altering event\" on Facebook and said he watched the storm's growth on satellite images with a pit growing in his stomach.\n\nFranklin County Sheriff A.J. Smith near the vulnerable coast said his deputies had gone door to door in some places urging people to evacuate. \"We have done everything we can as far as getting the word out,\" Smith said. \"Hopefully more people will leave.\"\n\nOn the exposed coast of Florida's Big Bend, most of the waterfront homes in Keaton Beach stood vacant amid fears of a life-threatening storm surge in an area that hadn't seen a potentially catastrophic major hurricane in decades. Even so, 77-year-old resident Robert Sadousky wasn't quite ready to evacuate yet.\n\nThe retired mill worker has spent more than half his life on the coast and weathered his share of storms. He chose the spot where his house stands on tall stilts overlooking the Gulf waters in 1972 after it was the only lot left dry after a storm flooded the beach that year.\n\nWhile most homes around him are vacation rentals or summer getaways for their owners, Sadousky had stayed put through more than four decades of storms. No longer. Michael was expected to bring surging seas up 9 feet (2.75 meters) above ground level at Keaton Beach.\n\n\"I know it's going to cover everything around here,\" Sadousky said Tuesday, eyeing water lapping at the edge of a canal behind his home. He pulled two small boat docks from the water, packed his pickup and picked some beans from his garden before getting out -- like hundreds of thousands elsewhere.\n\nAt 11 p.m. Tuesday, the eye of Michael was about 220 miles (355 kilometers) south-southwest of Panama City, Florida. It also was about 200 miles (325 kilometers) south-southwest of Apalachicola, Florida. But forecasters said winds and outer rain bands of a storm that was strengthening and becoming better organized by the hour would begin lashing the coast well ahead of the eye making landfall.\n\nMore than 180,000 people of those leaving were under mandatory evacuation orders, the long lines of cars jamming routes out Tuesday.\n\n\"We don't know if it's going to wipe out our house or not,\" Jason McDonald, of Panama City, said as he and his wife drove north to safety into Alabama with their two children, ages 5 and 7. \"We want to get them out of the way.\"\n\nFlorida Gov. Rick Scott warned it was a \"monstrous hurricane,\" and his Democratic opponent for the Senate, Sen. Bill Nelson, said a \"wall of water\" could cause destruction along the Panhandle.\n\n\"Don't think that you can ride this out if you're in a low-lying area,\" Nelson said on CNN.\n\nBut some officials were worried by what they weren't seeing -- a rush of evacuees.\n\n\"I am not seeing the level of traffic on the roadways that I would expect when we've called for the evacuation of 75 percent of this county,\" Bay County Sheriff Tommy Ford said.\n\nIn the dangerously exposed coastal town of Apalachicola, population 2,500, Sally Crown planned to go home and hunker down with her two dogs.\n\n\"We've been through this before,\" she said. \"This might be really bad and serious. But in my experience, it's always blown way out of proportion.\"\n\nMandatory evacuation orders went into effect in Panama City Beach and other low-lying areas in the storm's path. That included Pensacola Beach but not in Pensacola itself, a city of about 54,000.\n\nMichael could dump up to a foot (30 centimeters) of rain over some Panhandle communities before its remnants go back out to sea by way of the mid-Atlantic states over the next few days. Forecasters said it also could bring 3 to 6 inches of rain to Georgia, the Carolinas and Virginia, triggering flash flooding in a corner of the country still recovering from Florence.

Sorbe said the meeting was a valuable opportunity for Senate members to share their ideas with students involved in student government at other schools in the state.\n\n\"I think student federation is a good time for collaboration for student government associations across the state and to shoot ideas off of each other that we may be having and complications we might be having,\" Sorbe said. \"They are good people to bounce ideas off of because they are doing the same things we are doing just in different places.\"\n\nThe Board of Regents meeting covered a variety of topics including need-based financial aid, faculty salary competitiveness, Native American student enrollment and free speech policy revisions.\n\nSorbe said he found the first reading of the free speech policy an interesting point of discussion.\n\n\"They saw their first reading and it was approved to their second one where the Regents will most likely vote on the policy in December,\" Sorbe said. \"Outside of that, we also met South Dakota student federation out at Mines and there we discussed the Board of Regents priorities, which will be introduced in resolution from USD to student federation for all their agendas.\"\n\nSorbe and Green attended the meeting on behalf of USD, while the rest of the senators went on a volunteer basis. The Board of Regents meets every two months.\n\nSkunk said attending this meeting gave him an appreciation for USD's SGA.\n\n\"We should take pride in what we have as far as student government goes,\" Skunk said. \"If you look at the student federations at the School of Mines, their office is one room. We are very lucky here.\"\n\nAt this week's SGA meeting, the Senate relooked at five bills and one resolution. Three of the five bills were passed at this meeting. Senate Bill 78, which appropriates the budget for the Seldinger Society, Senate Bill 79, which approves the budget for the Philosophy club and Senate Bill 80 which appropriates the Math Club budget.\n\nThe other two bills, Senate Bill 76, which poses to change the SGA election dates and Senate Bill 77, which is on student organization recognition, will be brought back after going to internal reviews for the next meeting.\n\nSenate Resolution 6, which poses to change the MUC hours back to 2 a.m., was discussed and voted on, but it did not pass. Besides the discussion for this resolution, special guest Dan Dailey, Dean of Libraries, also addressed the Muenster University Center hours.\n\nDailey distributed a document of facts for the Senate to look at while he spoke. According to the document, I.D. Weeks Library originally began staying open till 2 a.m. in 2010. The dean of libraries and staff reviewed the policy again in 2014 and saw that there was the low utilization of the library, but decided to keep the policy as is.\n\nBefore the hour's change was made this school year, there was a thorough review of the current hours. Data was collected on the number of student present after midnight along with the use of computers after midnight.\n\n\"A very small fraction of those entries into I.D. Weeks happen after midnight during the weeknights,\" Daily said. \"I asked our staff to look at the utilization of I.D. Weeks after midnight, we dug into the statistics in 2017 and 2018.

The judge apparently wasn't impressed and he was released on that charge. However, the judge ordered him to stay away from Kanani (but now Kanani is suing him).\n\nSo, even though Williams doesn't have to worry about that charge, as we've reported, he's is still in lockdown in Portland because he's wanted in Georgia","source":{"uri":"eurweb.com","dataType":"news","title":"EURweb"},"authors":[],"eventUri":null,"location":null},{"uri":"965790367","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2018-10-10","time":"05:19:00","dateTime":"2018-10-10T05:19:00Z","dataType":"news","sim":0.6313725709915161,"url":"https://www.mediaite.com/tv/don-lemon-people-harassing-ted-cruz-at-restaurant-wasnt-mob-behavior-its-people-who-are-upset/","title":"Don Lemon: People Harassing Ted Cruz at Restaurant Wasn't 'Mob Behavior,' It's 'People Who Are Upset'","body":"CNN host Don Lemon took a similar stance with his colleague Brooke Baldwin about what defines a mob.\n\nEarlier in the day, Daily Beast columnist Matt Lewis argued that the anti-Kavanaugh protestors who harassed Sen.

Dall'Imis al fondo perequativo, dai nidi al trasporto pubblico, in assenza di informazioni abbiamo dovuto confermare i numeri dell'anno scorso\".\n\nLa proposta di bilancio completa sarà depositata il 15 novembre, un mese prima della discussione in aula.\n\nCome avviene ormai da svariati anni, tutti i Servizi comunali sono stati invitati a ridurre la spesa corrente e a calibrare bene le previsioni, in modo da non generare avanzo. Per quanto riguarda i contenuti della manovra, il sindaco ha sottolineato l'invarianza delle tariffe (\"al massimo ci sarà un adeguamento al tasso di inflazione programmata\"), l'aumento delle risorse per i lavori socialmente utili e per il turismo: \"E' un settore che tira - ha spiegato Andreatta - Quest'anno poi è andato particolarmente bene grazie alla concentrazione di grandi eventi ospitati in città\".\n\nMassima attenzione anche al sociale, con l'aumento (costante in questi anni) delle voci per l'integrazione dell'affitto e per supportare le famiglie più fragili. Naturalmente in primo piano resta anche il capitolo sicurezza, che prevede tra l'altro la sostituzione di tutti gli agenti che andranno in pensione e il rafforzamento della squadra aggiuntiva della polizia municipale, che diventa stabile e non più a termine come ai suoi esordi.\n\nTra i temi del confronto, pure il bando Periferie e il nodo dei 18 milioni di euro prima confermati e poi messi in dubbio dal governo nazionale: \"Pare che i fondi non ci siano stati tolti, ma siano stati posticipati al 2020 - ha spiegato l'assessore Gilmozzi - Se le risorse non arrivassero, ai Comuni è stata data la possibilità di utilizzare l'avanzo di bilancio. Non che la cosa ci faccia piacere, perché l'avanzo sono soldi nostri, non dello Stato\".\n\nL'assessore Gilmozzi si è soffermato anche sugli investimenti dei prossimi anni: dal restyling di piazza della Mostra alla nuova piscina, dal recupero dell'ex Atesina a quello dell'ex facoltà di Lettere, dal nuovo quartiere in viale dei Tigli ai numerosi interventi di manutenzione sul patrimonio edilizio esistente.\n\nI sindacati hanno invitato l'Amministrazione comunale a mantenere alta l'attenzione sulla sicurezza e sulla percezione della sicurezza da parte dei cittadini (Pomini) e sulle politiche di conciliazione per favorire il lavoro delle donne (Grosselli). Alotti ha sollecitato il sindaco ad aumentare la tassazione sulle case sfitte. E ancora Grosselli ha chiesto di mirare non solo alla riduzione dei costi ma anche alla tutela del lavoro negli appalti di servizi.","source":{"uri":"lavocedeltrentino.it","dataType":"news","title":"La Voce del Trentino Quotidiano online INDIPENDENTE"},"authors":[],"eventUri":null,"location":null},{"uri":"965790374","lang":"ita","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2018-10-10","time":"05:19:00","dateTime":"2018-10-10T05:19:00Z","dataType":"news","sim":0,"url":"https://www.lavocedeltrentino.it/2018/10/10/concluso-nel-migliore-dei-modi-lo-street-food-festival-levento-che-unisce-la-comunita-e-colora-le-strade/","title":"Concluso nel migliore dei modi lo Street Food Festival, l'evento che unisce la comunità e colora le strade - La voce del Trentino","body":"Si è conclusa domenica la terza edizione dello Street Food Festival, l'evento ha colorato le strade della città che, come sempre, sono state riempite dai profumi più disparati ed intriganti.\n\nSolo qualche giorno fa è stato celebrato un altro importante appuntamento, il Mercato Europeo.

The rest is not yet history as Gary Johnson, a former governor of New Mexico, seeks a seat in the U.S. Senate as a Libertarian and political wild card.\n\nJohnson says his high-desert home state of 2 million residents stands to gain considerable influence in the Senate if he is elected as a freewheeling swing vote -- possibly a decisive vote in the chamber, as Republicans defend a slim 51-49 majority in November elections.\n\nDemocrats are being forced to defend what had seemed like a secure seat for incumbent first-term Sen. Martin Heinrich, fending off Johnson's allure among voters as an uncompromising fiscal conservative with a quirky brand of free-market, pro-cannabis policies.\n\n\"Arguably if elected I would be the swing vote in the U.S. Senate, and that would be a big yank for New Mexico. It should benefit New Mexico in a really big way,\" Johnson tells a crowd of two dozen at a candidate forum in Tucumcari, near a string of abandoned highway-side motels, on the state's rural eastern plains.\n\nNationwide, Democrats are defending 26 incumbent Senate seats, while Republicans are defending only nine. The stakes in fall Senate races have been on dramatic display in Supreme Court confirmation proceedings amid accusations of sexual misconduct against nominee Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nJohnson says he would be a voice of common sense in the Senate and a rare nonpartisan vote during Supreme Court confirmation proceedings -- and an impartial judge in the event of a Senate impeachment trial against President Donald Trump, though he sees no impeachable offense so far.\n\nUntil then, Johnson applauds Trump's work at diminishing regulations, and denounces White House immigration policies as shameful and bad for the economy.\n\nThe real political crisis and looming threat to America's wellbeing, Johnson says, is runaway deficit spending. And the day of reckoning will come, according to Johnson, in the form of Venezuela-style inflation if the U.S. continues to spend beyond its means, on military and social programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.\n\n\"I applaud Trump on the tax cuts, but where is the spending reduction to go along with that,\" said Johnson, who wants to join the Senate Budget Committee that sets out Congress' broad blueprint for levels of federal revenues and spending.\n\nProminent Democrats say Johnson can't barge his way onto the committee, and they suspect he would readily collaborate to torpedo federal health care and nutritional subsidies that New Mexico relies on heavily.\n\nDede Feldman, a Democratic political strategist who served in the state Senate when Johnson was governor, questions Johnson's credentials as a voice of moderation, noting he was held in contempt as governor by the New Mexico Supreme Court for persisting with aggressive welfare changes without legislative approval.\n\nAt a community bank in Tucumcari, Johnson finds a receptive audience for his criticism of burdensome federal financial regulation in a meeting with the board of directors -- and some astonishment at his calls to decrease military spending by 23 percent, cut Medicare and retool Social Security.\n\n\"I'm 80 years old. I'm on Medicare, I receive Social Security, and I'm retired from the military,\" said Bill Curry, a board member at the Tucumcari Federal Savings and Loan Association, which was founded during the 1930s Great Depression. \"You've hit me on four different things.\"\n\nJohnson doesn't back down, cautioning social and retirement programs won't be around for future generations without prompt action.\n\nHe derides as a budget-buster his opponent Heinrich's support of \"Medicare-for-all\" legislation aimed at making strides toward universal health insurance coverage.\n\nHeinrich has cast himself as a defender of federal health and retirement benefits, and proponent of the new outdoor-recreation and renewable-energy economies -- a progressive hedge in an oil-based state economy.\n\nHeinrich, with youthful looks at age 46, has turned his committee appointments, including Armed Services, into a venue for expedient constituent politics in support of the New Mexico's military facilities and veterans.\n\nJohnson's answer to escalating medical costs is less regulation and even easing licensing requirement for medical professionals. His faith in free-market solutions with less regulation spills over into everything from oilfield methane emissions to public education, where Johnson supports government spending on independent schools through vouchers.\n\nPollsters and analysts see obstacles to Johnson building a quick coalition, after his late entry to the race in August.\n\n\"There are a lot of unaffiliated registered voters, but they tend to vote in half their numbers on low-turnout elections,\" said pollster Brian Sanderoff, of Research & Polling in Albuquerque. \"They're less likely to vote in nonpresidential election cycles.\"\n\nNew Mexico's Republican Party is calling Johnson a spoiler, saying he will draw votes from their candidate -- construction contractor and political newcomer Mick Rich -- playing directly into Democrats' hands.\n\nJohnson dismisses the GOP as a lost cause this year in New Mexico, which sided with Hillary Clinton in 2016 by a wide margin and twice backed Barack Obama.\n\n\"I do not think that a Republican can win a statewide race in New Mexico. I think that Trump has polluted those chances,\" he said.\n\nAs a Republican governor, Johnson vetoed more than 700 bills in perpetual standoffs with a Legislature run by Democrats, vetoing the entire budget in his final year only to have legislators override him. His advocacy as governor for marijuana legalization, beginning in 1999 when the stance was unpopular, still provides a political calling card -- one that Johnson says speaks to his honesty regardless of political consequences.\n\nCampaign disclosure filings show Johnson also is an investor in the nascent legal marijuana sector and a professional adviser to a cannabis hedge fund. He is a recreational user himself -- in a state that regulates medical marijuana access but still penalizes recreational cannabis.\n\nHeinrich, the Democrat, recently threw his support behind legalizing marijuana, while Johnson already is contemplating how to provide pardons for legions of drug-possession convicts.\n\nFor Johnson, a third act in politics at age 65 would mean setting aside a lifestyle of 100-day winter ski seasons and summer endurance bicycle rallies along the Continental Divide. Barnstorming through tiny towns to shake hands and deliver yard signs, Johnson said Trump has created the perfect storm for a Libertarian or truly independent candidate to join Congress and broker majority votes -- calling Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Angus King of Maine independents in name only.\n\nStopping unannounced at a barbecue stand at midday, Johnson ignites flickers of recognition and then conversations that often turn to his thoughts on cannabis.\n\n\"I love his policies,\" said Jace Alderson, 61, of Moriarty, recalling Johnson's hard-line stance against government spending as a Republican governor. \"It doesn't matter what party he is.\"","source":{"uri":"wral.com","dataType":"news","title":"WRAL.com"},"authors":[],"eventUri":null,"location":{"type":"place","label":{"eng":"Tucumcari, New Mexico"},"lat":35.17191,"long":-103.72686,"country":{"type":"country","label":{"eng":"United States"},"lat":39.76,"long":-98.5}}},{"uri":"965790356","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2018-10-10","time":"05:19:00","dateTime":"2018-10-10T05:19:00Z","dataType":"news","sim":0.6901960968971252,"url":"https://www.eurweb.com/2018/10/antonio-brown-sued-for-throwing-furniture-from-balcony-that-nearly-killed-toddler/","title":"Antonio Brown Sued for Throwing Furniture From Balcony That Nearly Killed Toddler","body":"According to TMZ, Brown snapped back in April and threw a bunch of furniture off the balcony of his 14th story luxury apartment, and some of it shattered near a 22-month-old baby.\n\nA lawsuit obtained by TMZ Sports states Antonio is being sued by Ophir Sternberg -- who claims it was his toddler son who was walking around the pool at the apartment complex with his grandfather when suddenly \"large objects started to fall from the building many floors above them.\"\n\nOTHER NEWS YOU MIGHT HAVE MISSED: Kanye West and Donald Trump Have a Lunch Date at the White House\n\nSternberg claims the items included: 2 very large vases, a heavy ottoman and other pieces of furniture.

Around midday it was expected to become one of the Panhandle's worst hurricanes in memory with 125 mph winds and a life-threatening storm surge of up to 13 feet (4 meters).\n\nFlorida officials said roughly 375,000 people up and down the Gulf Coast had been urged or ordered to evacuate. Evacuations spanned 22 counties from the Florida Panhandle into north central Florida. But fears lingered that some failed to heed the calls to get out of Michael's way as the hard-charging storm began speeding north over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nWorried meteorologists said it had the potential of becoming one of the worst storms in the history of Florida's Panhandle.\n\n\"I guess it's the worst case scenario. I don't think anyone would have experienced this in the Panhandle,\" meteorologist Ryan Maue of weathermodels.com told The Associated Press. \"This is going to have structure damaging winds along the coast and hurricane force winds inland.\"\n\nUniversity of Georgia's Marshall Shepherd, a former president of the American Meteorological Society, called it a \"life-altering event\" on Facebook and said he watched the storm's growth on satellite images with a pit growing in his stomach.\n\nFranklin County Sheriff A.J. Smith near the vulnerable coast said his deputies had gone door to door in some places urging people to evacuate. \"We have done everything we can as far as getting the word out,\" Smith said. \"Hopefully more people will leave.\"\n\nOn the exposed coast of Florida's Big Bend, most of the waterfront homes in Keaton Beach stood vacant amid fears of a life-threatening storm surge in an area that hadn't seen a potentially catastrophic major hurricane in decades. Even so, 77-year-old resident Robert Sadousky wasn't quite ready to evacuate yet.\n\nThe retired mill worker has spent more than half his life on the coast and weathered his share of storms. He chose the spot where his house stands on tall stilts overlooking the Gulf waters in 1972 after it was the only lot left dry after a storm flooded the beach that year.\n\nWhile most homes around him are vacation rentals or summer getaways for their owners, Sadousky had stayed put through more than four decades of storms. No longer. Michael was expected to bring surging seas up 9 feet (2.75 meters) above ground level at Keaton Beach.\n\n\"I know it's going to cover everything around here,\" Sadousky said Tuesday, eyeing water lapping at the edge of a canal behind his home. He pulled two small boat docks from the water, packed his pickup and picked some beans from his garden before getting out -- like hundreds of thousands elsewhere.\n\nAt 11 p.m. Tuesday, the eye of Michael was about 220 miles (355 kilometers) south-southwest of Panama City, Florida. It also was about 200 miles (325 kilometers) south-southwest of Apalachicola, Florida. But forecasters said winds and outer rain bands of a storm that was strengthening and becoming better organized by the hour would begin lashing the coast well ahead of the eye making landfall.\n\nMore than 180,000 people of those leaving were under mandatory evacuation orders, the long lines of cars jamming routes out Tuesday.\n\n\"We don't know if it's going to wipe out our house or not,\" Jason McDonald, of Panama City, said as he and his wife drove north to safety into Alabama with their two children, ages 5 and 7. \"We want to get them out of the way.\"\n\nFlorida Gov. Rick Scott warned it was a \"monstrous hurricane,\" and his Democratic opponent for the Senate, Sen. Bill Nelson, said a \"wall of water\" could cause destruction along the Panhandle.\n\n\"Don't think that you can ride this out if you're in a low-lying area,\" Nelson said on CNN.\n\nBut some officials were worried by what they weren't seeing -- a rush of evacuees.\n\n\"I am not seeing the level of traffic on the roadways that I would expect when we've called for the evacuation of 75 percent of this county,\" Bay County Sheriff Tommy Ford said.\n\nIn the dangerously exposed coastal town of Apalachicola, population 2,500, Sally Crown planned to go home and hunker down with her two dogs.\n\n\"We've been through this before,\" she said. \"This might be really bad and serious. But in my experience, it's always blown way out of proportion.\"\n\nMandatory evacuation orders went into effect in Panama City Beach and other low-lying areas in the storm's path. That included Pensacola Beach but not in Pensacola itself, a city of about 54,000.\n\nMichael could dump up to a foot (30 centimeters) of rain over some Panhandle communities before its remnants go back out to sea by way of the mid-Atlantic states over the next few days. Forecasters said it also could bring 3 to 6 inches of rain to Georgia, the Carolinas and Virginia, triggering flash flooding in a corner of the country still recovering from Florence. And isolated tornadoes were also possible.\n\nLush reported from St. Petersburg, Florida. Associated Press writers Russ Bynum in Keaton Beach, Florida, Jay Reeves in Panama City Beach, Florida, Jonathan Drew in Raleigh, North Carolina and Science Writer Seth Borenstein in Kensington, Maryland, contributed to this report.","source":{"uri":"wral.com","dataType":"news","title":"WRAL.com"},"authors":[],"eventUri":null,"location":null},{"uri":"965789282","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2018-10-10","time":"05:17:00","dateTime":"2018-10-10T05:17:00Z","dataType":"news","sim":0,"url":"http://volanteonline.com/2018/10/sga-senators-reflect-on-board-of-regents-meeting-last-tuesday/","title":"SGA senators reflect on Board of Regents meeting last Tuesday","body":"USD's Student Government Association resumed their weekly meetings after canceling last Tuesday's meeting in order to attend the Board of Regents meeting in Rapid City.\n\nSGA sent five members to the meeting, including SGA president Josh Sorbe, vice president Madison Green, office manager Amber Hulse, senator Matt Yetter and senator Christian Skunk.\n\nThe meeting was held in Rapid City at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology. Sorbe said the meeting was a valuable opportunity for Senate members to share their ideas with students involved in student government at other schools in the state.\n\n\"I think student federation is a good time for collaboration for student government associations across the state and to shoot ideas off of each other that we may be having and complications we might be having,\" Sorbe said. \"They are good people to bounce ideas off of because they are doing the same things we are doing just in different places.\"\n\nThe Board of Regents meeting covered a variety of topics including need-based financial aid, faculty salary competitiveness, Native American student enrollment and free speech policy revisions.\n\nSorbe said he found the first reading of the free speech policy an interesting point of discussion.\n\n\"They saw their first reading and it was approved to their second one where the Regents will most likely vote on the policy in December,\" Sorbe said. \"Outside of that, we also met South Dakota student federation out at Mines and there we discussed the Board of Regents priorities, which will be introduced in resolution from USD to student federation for all their agendas.\"\n\nSorbe and Green attended the meeting on behalf of USD, while the rest of the senators went on a volunteer basis. The Board of Regents meets every two months.\n\nSkunk said attending this meeting gave him an appreciation for USD's SGA.\n\n\"We should take pride in what we have as far as student government goes,\" Skunk said. \"If you look at the student federations at the School of Mines, their office is one room. We are very lucky here.\"\n\nAt this week's SGA meeting, the Senate relooked at five bills and one resolution. Three of the five bills were passed at this meeting. Senate Bill 78, which appropriates the budget for the Seldinger Society, Senate Bill 79, which approves the budget for the Philosophy club and Senate Bill 80 which appropriates the Math Club budget.\n\nThe other two bills, Senate Bill 76, which poses to change the SGA election dates and Senate Bill 77, which is on student organization recognition, will be brought back after going to internal reviews for the next meeting.\n\nSenate Resolution 6, which poses to change the MUC hours back to 2 a.m., was discussed and voted on, but it did not pass. Besides the discussion for this resolution, special guest Dan Dailey, Dean of Libraries, also addressed the Muenster University Center hours.\n\nDailey distributed a document of facts for the Senate to look at while he spoke. According to the document, I.D. Weeks Library originally began staying open till 2 a.m. in 2010. The dean of libraries and staff reviewed the policy again in 2014 and saw that there was the low utilization of the library, but decided to keep the policy as is.\n\nBefore the hour's change was made this school year, there was a thorough review of the current hours. Data was collected on the number of student present after midnight along with the use of computers after midnight.\n\n\"A very small fraction of those entries into I.D. Weeks happen after midnight during the weeknights,\" Daily said. \"I asked our staff to look at the utilization of I.D. Weeks after midnight, we dug into the statistics in 2017 and 2018. We've been as diligent as possible in terms of redirecting available dollars going towards the libraries.\"","source":{"uri":"volanteonline.com","dataType":"news","title":"The Volante"},"authors":[{"uri":"lexi_kerzman@volanteonline.com","name":"Lexi Kerzman","type":"author","isAgency":false}],"eventUri":null,"location":null},{"uri":"965790355","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2018-10-10","time":"05:19:00","dateTime":"2018-10-10T05:19:00Z","dataType":"news","sim":0,"url":"https://www.eurweb.com/2018/10/kevin-hart-saw-two-women-sht-on-themselves-during-chicago-marathon-watch/","title":"Kevin Hart Saw Two Women Poop on Themselves During Chicago Marathon [WATCH]","body":"[display-posts wrapper=\"div\" wrapper_class=\"my-grid-layout\" category=\"trending-news\" posts_per_page=\"3\" include_title=\"true\" include_link=\"false\" include_date=\"true\" date_format=\"F j, Y\" image_size=\"large\" trending_posts=\"true\"]\n\n*After some inspirational words of advice, Kevin Hart finished strong at the 2018 Bank of America Chicago Marathon on Sunday (Oct. 7).\n\nThe comedian announced in August that he would be running the iconic marathon, with hopes of beating his time from last year's New York City Marathon.\n\nHart posted a video on Instagram early Thursday of himself on Chicago's Lakefront Trail, sharing his reason for participating in the race.\n\n\"I told you guys I put a purpose behind the run. In other words, there's a meaning, there's a definition, there's a reason,\" he said. \"The reason behind this run is simply first and foremost personal greatness, personal achievement but also what I can bring awareness to, what I can raise money for,\" he continued before shouting, \"Education!\"\n\nOTHER NEWS YOU MIGHT HAVE MISSED: Blac Chyna A SlutWalk No-show (She & Amber UNfollow Each Other)\n\nKevin also shared a video after crossing the finish line Sunday, and even though he was disappointed in his time, he was happy he participated.\n\nAs reported by The Blast, Hart, who finished 18,057 with a time of 4:13:10, says he broke down hard at mile 22 with cramps that felt like \"Someone shot me in my ass, calf, and hamstring.\"\n\nHe said sh*t got real when he \"Saw two older women sh*t on themselves,\" including one woman who popped a squat in front of everyone and just \"Moved her shorts to the side.\"\n\nWatch him explain it via the clip above.\n\nMeanwhile, reviews have been largely negative for his latest movie \"Night School\" but for Kevin, it's the fan's opinions that matter most, as he recently explained:\n\n\"It's been so positive from the fans. The main reason I never really feed into any reviews or articles before the movie comes out is because movies are made for the people. The beautiful thing about getting that 'A-' CinemaScore is it shows that there is a demand for comedy. It adds to my reason for never listening to the critics or feeding into the reviews.

Well, he's in that space again because the man who says he was assaulted by Williams last Friday in Portland is suing the funnyman for $76,000.\n\nHis lawyer says the money is for his physical injuries and emotional distress. The alleged victim's name is Wali Kanani and he's the owner of Delta Town Car Service in Portland.\n\nKanani was picking up Williams, his German Shepherd, and his colleagues at a private hanger of the airport, reports Fox12.\n\nThe complaint, filed Monday, states Williams insisted his dog sit in the front seat, and Kanani said no.\n\nThe document outlines what happened from there. It alleges Williams called Kanani names like \"white trash,\" then punched him in the face.\n\nKanani ran inside to get away and Williams reportedly \"commanded his dog to start chasing\" him, according to court documents.\n\n\"This is totally inappropriate behavior and there has to be some sort of deterrent effect above and beyond what the lawsuit itself would bring,\" Kanani's attorney Adam Heder said.\n\nThat's why Heder filed the complaint now asking for $76,000 plus medical costs.\n\nREAD THIS/BLIND ITEM: HIS 'GIRLFRIEND' IS PRETTY MUCH AN AFTERTHOUGHT\n\nThe article goes on to say that Attorney Heder wouldn't provide photos of Kanani's injuries, but said he had cuts and swelling on his face, a broken tooth and tinnitus in one ear, as well as what he's suffered emotionally.\n\n\"You can imagine in the course of doing your job getting struck in the face in this aggressive and belligerent manner can cause a tremendous amount of emotional distress to even the best of us,\" Heder said.\n\nAs far as what's happening with Williams in court, on Monday he had a hearing on the charge of assault in the fourth degree. The judge apparently wasn't impressed and he was released on that charge. However, the judge ordered him to stay away from Kanani (but now Kanani is suing him).\n\nSo, even though Williams doesn't have to worry about that charge, as we've reported, he's is still in lockdown in Portland because he's wanted in Georgia","source":{"uri":"eurweb.com","dataType":"news","title":"EURweb"},"authors":[],"eventUri":null,"location":null},{"uri":"965790367","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2018-10-10","time":"05:19:00","dateTime":"2018-10-10T05:19:00Z","dataType":"news","sim":0.6313725709915161,"url":"https://www.mediaite.com/tv/don-lemon-people-harassing-ted-cruz-at-restaurant-wasnt-mob-behavior-its-people-who-are-upset/","title":"Don Lemon: People Harassing Ted Cruz at Restaurant Wasn't 'Mob Behavior,' It's 'People Who Are Upset'","body":"CNN host Don Lemon took a similar stance with his colleague Brooke Baldwin about what defines a mob.\n\nEarlier in the day, Daily Beast columnist Matt Lewis argued that the anti-Kavanaugh protestors who harassed Sen.

Dall'Imis al fondo perequativo, dai nidi al trasporto pubblico, in assenza di informazioni abbiamo dovuto confermare i numeri dell'anno scorso\".\n\nLa proposta di bilancio completa sarà depositata il 15 novembre, un mese prima della discussione in aula.\n\nCome avviene ormai da svariati anni, tutti i Servizi comunali sono stati invitati a ridurre la spesa corrente e a calibrare bene le previsioni, in modo da non generare avanzo. Per quanto riguarda i contenuti della manovra, il sindaco ha sottolineato l'invarianza delle tariffe (\"al massimo ci sarà un adeguamento al tasso di inflazione programmata\"), l'aumento delle risorse per i lavori socialmente utili e per il turismo: \"E' un settore che tira - ha spiegato Andreatta - Quest'anno poi è andato particolarmente bene grazie alla concentrazione di grandi eventi ospitati in città\".\n\nMassima attenzione anche al sociale, con l'aumento (costante in questi anni) delle voci per l'integrazione dell'affitto e per supportare le famiglie più fragili. Naturalmente in primo piano resta anche il capitolo sicurezza, che prevede tra l'altro la sostituzione di tutti gli agenti che andranno in pensione e il rafforzamento della squadra aggiuntiva della polizia municipale, che diventa stabile e non più a termine come ai suoi esordi.\n\nTra i temi del confronto, pure il bando Periferie e il nodo dei 18 milioni di euro prima confermati e poi messi in dubbio dal governo nazionale: \"Pare che i fondi non ci siano stati tolti, ma siano stati posticipati al 2020 - ha spiegato l'assessore Gilmozzi - Se le risorse non arrivassero, ai Comuni è stata data la possibilità di utilizzare l'avanzo di bilancio. Non che la cosa ci faccia piacere, perché l'avanzo sono soldi nostri, non dello Stato\".\n\nL'assessore Gilmozzi si è soffermato anche sugli investimenti dei prossimi anni: dal restyling di piazza della Mostra alla nuova piscina, dal recupero dell'ex Atesina a quello dell'ex facoltà di Lettere, dal nuovo quartiere in viale dei Tigli ai numerosi interventi di manutenzione sul patrimonio edilizio esistente.\n\nI sindacati hanno invitato l'Amministrazione comunale a mantenere alta l'attenzione sulla sicurezza e sulla percezione della sicurezza da parte dei cittadini (Pomini) e sulle politiche di conciliazione per favorire il lavoro delle donne (Grosselli). Alotti ha sollecitato il sindaco ad aumentare la tassazione sulle case sfitte. E ancora Grosselli ha chiesto di mirare non solo alla riduzione dei costi ma anche alla tutela del lavoro negli appalti di servizi.","source":{"uri":"lavocedeltrentino.it","dataType":"news","title":"La Voce del Trentino Quotidiano online INDIPENDENTE"},"authors":[],"eventUri":null,"location":null},{"uri":"965790374","lang":"ita","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2018-10-10","time":"05:19:00","dateTime":"2018-10-10T05:19:00Z","dataType":"news","sim":0,"url":"https://www.lavocedeltrentino.it/2018/10/10/concluso-nel-migliore-dei-modi-lo-street-food-festival-levento-che-unisce-la-comunita-e-colora-le-strade/","title":"Concluso nel migliore dei modi lo Street Food Festival, l'evento che unisce la comunità e colora le strade - La voce del Trentino","body":"Si è conclusa domenica la terza edizione dello Street Food Festival, l'evento ha colorato le strade della città che, come sempre, sono state riempite dai profumi più disparati ed intriganti.\n\nSolo qualche giorno fa è stato celebrato un altro importante appuntamento, il Mercato Europeo.

The rest is not yet history as Gary Johnson, a former governor of New Mexico, seeks a seat in the U.S. Senate as a Libertarian and political wild card.\n\nJohnson says his high-desert home state of 2 million residents stands to gain considerable influence in the Senate if he is elected as a freewheeling swing vote -- possibly a decisive vote in the chamber, as Republicans defend a slim 51-49 majority in November elections.\n\nDemocrats are being forced to defend what had seemed like a secure seat for incumbent first-term Sen. Martin Heinrich, fending off Johnson's allure among voters as an uncompromising fiscal conservative with a quirky brand of free-market, pro-cannabis policies.\n\n\"Arguably if elected I would be the swing vote in the U.S. Senate, and that would be a big yank for New Mexico. It should benefit New Mexico in a really big way,\" Johnson tells a crowd of two dozen at a candidate forum in Tucumcari, near a string of abandoned highway-side motels, on the state's rural eastern plains.\n\nNationwide, Democrats are defending 26 incumbent Senate seats, while Republicans are defending only nine. The stakes in fall Senate races have been on dramatic display in Supreme Court confirmation proceedings amid accusations of sexual misconduct against nominee Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nJohnson says he would be a voice of common sense in the Senate and a rare nonpartisan vote during Supreme Court confirmation proceedings -- and an impartial judge in the event of a Senate impeachment trial against President Donald Trump, though he sees no impeachable offense so far.\n\nUntil then, Johnson applauds Trump's work at diminishing regulations, and denounces White House immigration policies as shameful and bad for the economy.\n\nThe real political crisis and looming threat to America's wellbeing, Johnson says, is runaway deficit spending. And the day of reckoning will come, according to Johnson, in the form of Venezuela-style inflation if the U.S. continues to spend beyond its means, on military and social programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.\n\n\"I applaud Trump on the tax cuts, but where is the spending reduction to go along with that,\" said Johnson, who wants to join the Senate Budget Committee that sets out Congress' broad blueprint for levels of federal revenues and spending.\n\nProminent Democrats say Johnson can't barge his way onto the committee, and they suspect he would readily collaborate to torpedo federal health care and nutritional subsidies that New Mexico relies on heavily.\n\nDede Feldman, a Democratic political strategist who served in the state Senate when Johnson was governor, questions Johnson's credentials as a voice of moderation, noting he was held in contempt as governor by the New Mexico Supreme Court for persisting with aggressive welfare changes without legislative approval.\n\nAt a community bank in Tucumcari, Johnson finds a receptive audience for his criticism of burdensome federal financial regulation in a meeting with the board of directors -- and some astonishment at his calls to decrease military spending by 23 percent, cut Medicare and retool Social Security.\n\n\"I'm 80 years old. I'm on Medicare, I receive Social Security, and I'm retired from the military,\" said Bill Curry, a board member at the Tucumcari Federal Savings and Loan Association, which was founded during the 1930s Great Depression. \"You've hit me on four different things.\"\n\nJohnson doesn't back down, cautioning social and retirement programs won't be around for future generations without prompt action.\n\nHe derides as a budget-buster his opponent Heinrich's support of \"Medicare-for-all\" legislation aimed at making strides toward universal health insurance coverage.\n\nHeinrich has cast himself as a defender of federal health and retirement benefits, and proponent of the new outdoor-recreation and renewable-energy economies -- a progressive hedge in an oil-based state economy.\n\nHeinrich, with youthful looks at age 46, has turned his committee appointments, including Armed Services, into a venue for expedient constituent politics in support of the New Mexico's military facilities and veterans.\n\nJohnson's answer to escalating medical costs is less regulation and even easing licensing requirement for medical professionals. His faith in free-market solutions with less regulation spills over into everything from oilfield methane emissions to public education, where Johnson supports government spending on independent schools through vouchers.\n\nPollsters and analysts see obstacles to Johnson building a quick coalition, after his late entry to the race in August.\n\n\"There are a lot of unaffiliated registered voters, but they tend to vote in half their numbers on low-turnout elections,\" said pollster Brian Sanderoff, of Research & Polling in Albuquerque. \"They're less likely to vote in nonpresidential election cycles.\"\n\nNew Mexico's Republican Party is calling Johnson a spoiler, saying he will draw votes from their candidate -- construction contractor and political newcomer Mick Rich -- playing directly into Democrats' hands.\n\nJohnson dismisses the GOP as a lost cause this year in New Mexico, which sided with Hillary Clinton in 2016 by a wide margin and twice backed Barack Obama.\n\n\"I do not think that a Republican can win a statewide race in New Mexico. I think that Trump has polluted those chances,\" he said.\n\nAs a Republican governor, Johnson vetoed more than 700 bills in perpetual standoffs with a Legislature run by Democrats, vetoing the entire budget in his final year only to have legislators override him. His advocacy as governor for marijuana legalization, beginning in 1999 when the stance was unpopular, still provides a political calling card -- one that Johnson says speaks to his honesty regardless of political consequences.\n\nCampaign disclosure filings show Johnson also is an investor in the nascent legal marijuana sector and a professional adviser to a cannabis hedge fund. He is a recreational user himself -- in a state that regulates medical marijuana access but still penalizes recreational cannabis.\n\nHeinrich, the Democrat, recently threw his support behind legalizing marijuana, while Johnson already is contemplating how to provide pardons for legions of drug-possession convicts.\n\nFor Johnson, a third act in politics at age 65 would mean setting aside a lifestyle of 100-day winter ski seasons and summer endurance bicycle rallies along the Continental Divide. Barnstorming through tiny towns to shake hands and deliver yard signs, Johnson said Trump has created the perfect storm for a Libertarian or truly independent candidate to join Congress and broker majority votes -- calling Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Angus King of Maine independents in name only.\n\nStopping unannounced at a barbecue stand at midday, Johnson ignites flickers of recognition and then conversations that often turn to his thoughts on cannabis.\n\n\"I love his policies,\" said Jace Alderson, 61, of Moriarty, recalling Johnson's hard-line stance against government spending as a Republican governor. \"It doesn't matter what party he is.\"","source":{"uri":"wral.com","dataType":"news","title":"WRAL.com"},"authors":[],"eventUri":null,"location":{"type":"place","label":{"eng":"Tucumcari, New Mexico"},"lat":35.17191,"long":-103.72686,"country":{"type":"country","label":{"eng":"United States"},"lat":39.76,"long":-98.5}}},{"uri":"965790356","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2018-10-10","time":"05:19:00","dateTime":"2018-10-10T05:19:00Z","dataType":"news","sim":0.6901960968971252,"url":"https://www.eurweb.com/2018/10/antonio-brown-sued-for-throwing-furniture-from-balcony-that-nearly-killed-toddler/","title":"Antonio Brown Sued for Throwing Furniture From Balcony That Nearly Killed Toddler","body":"According to TMZ, Brown snapped back in April and threw a bunch of furniture off the balcony of his 14th story luxury apartment, and some of it shattered near a 22-month-old baby.\n\nA lawsuit obtained by TMZ Sports states Antonio is being sued by Ophir Sternberg -- who claims it was his toddler son who was walking around the pool at the apartment complex with his grandfather when suddenly \"large objects started to fall from the building many floors above them.\"\n\nOTHER NEWS YOU MIGHT HAVE MISSED: Kanye West and Donald Trump Have a Lunch Date at the White House\n\nSternberg claims the items included: 2 very large vases, a heavy ottoman and other pieces of furniture.

Around midday it was expected to become one of the Panhandle's worst hurricanes in memory with 125 mph winds and a life-threatening storm surge of up to 13 feet (4 meters).\n\nFlorida officials said roughly 375,000 people up and down the Gulf Coast had been urged or ordered to evacuate. Evacuations spanned 22 counties from the Florida Panhandle into north central Florida. But fears lingered that some failed to heed the calls to get out of Michael's way as the hard-charging storm began speeding north over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nWorried meteorologists said it had the potential of becoming one of the worst storms in the history of Florida's Panhandle.\n\n\"I guess it's the worst case scenario. I don't think anyone would have experienced this in the Panhandle,\" meteorologist Ryan Maue of weathermodels.com told The Associated Press. \"This is going to have structure damaging winds along the coast and hurricane force winds inland.\"\n\nUniversity of Georgia's Marshall Shepherd, a former president of the American Meteorological Society, called it a \"life-altering event\" on Facebook and said he watched the storm's growth on satellite images with a pit growing in his stomach.\n\nFranklin County Sheriff A.J. Smith near the vulnerable coast said his deputies had gone door to door in some places urging people to evacuate. \"We have done everything we can as far as getting the word out,\" Smith said. \"Hopefully more people will leave.\"\n\nOn the exposed coast of Florida's Big Bend, most of the waterfront homes in Keaton Beach stood vacant amid fears of a life-threatening storm surge in an area that hadn't seen a potentially catastrophic major hurricane in decades. Even so, 77-year-old resident Robert Sadousky wasn't quite ready to evacuate yet.\n\nThe retired mill worker has spent more than half his life on the coast and weathered his share of storms. He chose the spot where his house stands on tall stilts overlooking the Gulf waters in 1972 after it was the only lot left dry after a storm flooded the beach that year.\n\nWhile most homes around him are vacation rentals or summer getaways for their owners, Sadousky had stayed put through more than four decades of storms. No longer. Michael was expected to bring surging seas up 9 feet (2.75 meters) above ground level at Keaton Beach.\n\n\"I know it's going to cover everything around here,\" Sadousky said Tuesday, eyeing water lapping at the edge of a canal behind his home. He pulled two small boat docks from the water, packed his pickup and picked some beans from his garden before getting out -- like hundreds of thousands elsewhere.\n\nAt 11 p.m. Tuesday, the eye of Michael was about 220 miles (355 kilometers) south-southwest of Panama City, Florida. It also was about 200 miles (325 kilometers) south-southwest of Apalachicola, Florida. But forecasters said winds and outer rain bands of a storm that was strengthening and becoming better organized by the hour would begin lashing the coast well ahead of the eye making landfall.\n\nMore than 180,000 people of those leaving were under mandatory evacuation orders, the long lines of cars jamming routes out Tuesday.\n\n\"We don't know if it's going to wipe out our house or not,\" Jason McDonald, of Panama City, said as he and his wife drove north to safety into Alabama with their two children, ages 5 and 7. \"We want to get them out of the way.\"\n\nFlorida Gov. Rick Scott warned it was a \"monstrous hurricane,\" and his Democratic opponent for the Senate, Sen. Bill Nelson, said a \"wall of water\" could cause destruction along the Panhandle.\n\n\"Don't think that you can ride this out if you're in a low-lying area,\" Nelson said on CNN.\n\nBut some officials were worried by what they weren't seeing -- a rush of evacuees.\n\n\"I am not seeing the level of traffic on the roadways that I would expect when we've called for the evacuation of 75 percent of this county,\" Bay County Sheriff Tommy Ford said.\n\nIn the dangerously exposed coastal town of Apalachicola, population 2,500, Sally Crown planned to go home and hunker down with her two dogs.\n\n\"We've been through this before,\" she said. \"This might be really bad and serious. But in my experience, it's always blown way out of proportion.\"\n\nMandatory evacuation orders went into effect in Panama City Beach and other low-lying areas in the storm's path. That included Pensacola Beach but not in Pensacola itself, a city of about 54,000.\n\nMichael could dump up to a foot (30 centimeters) of rain over some Panhandle communities before its remnants go back out to sea by way of the mid-Atlantic states over the next few days. Forecasters said it also could bring 3 to 6 inches of rain to Georgia, the Carolinas and Virginia, triggering flash flooding in a corner of the country still recovering from Florence. And isolated tornadoes were also possible.\n\nLush reported from St. Petersburg, Florida.

Sorbe said the meeting was a valuable opportunity for Senate members to share their ideas with students involved in student government at other schools in the state.\n\n\"I think student federation is a good time for collaboration for student government associations across the state and to shoot ideas off of each other that we may be having and complications we might be having,\" Sorbe said. \"They are good people to bounce ideas off of because they are doing the same things we are doing just in different places.\"\n\nThe Board of Regents meeting covered a variety of topics including need-based financial aid, faculty salary competitiveness, Native American student enrollment and free speech policy revisions.\n\nSorbe said he found the first reading of the free speech policy an interesting point of discussion.\n\n\"They saw their first reading and it was approved to their second one where the Regents will most likely vote on the policy in December,\" Sorbe said. \"Outside of that, we also met South Dakota student federation out at Mines and there we discussed the Board of Regents priorities, which will be introduced in resolution from USD to student federation for all their agendas.\"\n\nSorbe and Green attended the meeting on behalf of USD, while the rest of the senators went on a volunteer basis. The Board of Regents meets every two months.\n\nSkunk said attending this meeting gave him an appreciation for USD's SGA.\n\n\"We should take pride in what we have as far as student government goes,\" Skunk said. \"If you look at the student federations at the School of Mines, their office is one room. We are very lucky here.\"\n\nAt this week's SGA meeting, the Senate relooked at five bills and one resolution. Three of the five bills were passed at this meeting. Senate Bill 78, which appropriates the budget for the Seldinger Society, Senate Bill 79, which approves the budget for the Philosophy club and Senate Bill 80 which appropriates the Math Club budget.\n\nThe other two bills, Senate Bill 76, which poses to change the SGA election dates and Senate Bill 77, which is on student organization recognition, will be brought back after going to internal reviews for the next meeting.\n\nSenate Resolution 6, which poses to change the MUC hours back to 2 a.m., was discussed and voted on, but it did not pass. Besides the discussion for this resolution, special guest Dan Dailey, Dean of Libraries, also addressed the Muenster University Center hours.\n\nDailey distributed a document of facts for the Senate to look at while he spoke. According to the document, I.D. Weeks Library originally began staying open till 2 a.m. in 2010. The dean of libraries and staff reviewed the policy again in 2014 and saw that there was the low utilization of the library, but decided to keep the policy as is.\n\nBefore the hour's change was made this school year, there was a thorough review of the current hours. Data was collected on the number of student present after midnight along with the use of computers after midnight.\n\n\"A very small fraction of those entries into I.D. Weeks happen after midnight during the weeknights,\" Daily said. \"I asked our staff to look at the utilization of I.D. Weeks after midnight, we dug into the statistics in 2017 and 2018.

Well, he's in that space again because the man who says he was assaulted by Williams last Friday in Portland is suing the funnyman for $76,000.\n\nHis lawyer says the money is for his physical injuries and emotional distress. The alleged victim's name is Wali Kanani and he's the owner of Delta Town Car Service in Portland.\n\nKanani was picking up Williams, his German Shepherd, and his colleagues at a private hanger of the airport, reports Fox12.\n\nThe complaint, filed Monday, states Williams insisted his dog sit in the front seat, and Kanani said no.\n\nThe document outlines what happened from there. It alleges Williams called Kanani names like \"white trash,\" then punched him in the face.\n\nKanani ran inside to get away and Williams reportedly \"commanded his dog to start chasing\" him, according to court documents.\n\n\"This is totally inappropriate behavior and there has to be some sort of deterrent effect above and beyond what the lawsuit itself would bring,\" Kanani's attorney Adam Heder said.\n\nThat's why Heder filed the complaint now asking for $76,000 plus medical costs.\n\nREAD THIS/BLIND ITEM: HIS 'GIRLFRIEND' IS PRETTY MUCH AN AFTERTHOUGHT\n\nThe article goes on to say that Attorney Heder wouldn't provide photos of Kanani's injuries, but said he had cuts and swelling on his face, a broken tooth and tinnitus in one ear, as well as what he's suffered emotionally.\n\n\"You can imagine in the course of doing your job getting struck in the face in this aggressive and belligerent manner can cause a tremendous amount of emotional distress to even the best of us,\" Heder said.\n\nAs far as what's happening with Williams in court, on Monday he had a hearing on the charge of assault in the fourth degree. The judge apparently wasn't impressed and he was released on that charge. However, the judge ordered him to stay away from Kanani (but now Kanani is suing him).\n\nSo, even though Williams doesn't have to worry about that charge, as we've reported, he's is still in lockdown in Portland because he's wanted in Georgia","source":{"uri":"eurweb.com","dataType":"news","title":"EURweb"},"authors":[],"eventUri":null,"location":null},{"uri":"965790367","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2018-10-10","time":"05:19:00","dateTime":"2018-10-10T05:19:00Z","dataType":"news","sim":0.6313725709915161,"url":"https://www.mediaite.com/tv/don-lemon-people-harassing-ted-cruz-at-restaurant-wasnt-mob-behavior-its-people-who-are-upset/","title":"Don Lemon: People Harassing Ted Cruz at Restaurant Wasn't 'Mob Behavior,' It's 'People Who Are Upset'","body":"CNN host Don Lemon took a similar stance with his colleague Brooke Baldwin about what defines a mob.\n\nEarlier in the day, Daily Beast columnist Matt Lewis argued that the anti-Kavanaugh protestors who harassed Sen.

Dall'Imis al fondo perequativo, dai nidi al trasporto pubblico, in assenza di informazioni abbiamo dovuto confermare i numeri dell'anno scorso\".\n\nLa proposta di bilancio completa sarà depositata il 15 novembre, un mese prima della discussione in aula.\n\nCome avviene ormai da svariati anni, tutti i Servizi comunali sono stati invitati a ridurre la spesa corrente e a calibrare bene le previsioni, in modo da non generare avanzo. Per quanto riguarda i contenuti della manovra, il sindaco ha sottolineato l'invarianza delle tariffe (\"al massimo ci sarà un adeguamento al tasso di inflazione programmata\"), l'aumento delle risorse per i lavori socialmente utili e per il turismo: \"E' un settore che tira - ha spiegato Andreatta - Quest'anno poi è andato particolarmente bene grazie alla concentrazione di grandi eventi ospitati in città\".\n\nMassima attenzione anche al sociale, con l'aumento (costante in questi anni) delle voci per l'integrazione dell'affitto e per supportare le famiglie più fragili. Naturalmente in primo piano resta anche il capitolo sicurezza, che prevede tra l'altro la sostituzione di tutti gli agenti che andranno in pensione e il rafforzamento della squadra aggiuntiva della polizia municipale, che diventa stabile e non più a termine come ai suoi esordi.\n\nTra i temi del confronto, pure il bando Periferie e il nodo dei 18 milioni di euro prima confermati e poi messi in dubbio dal governo nazionale: \"Pare che i fondi non ci siano stati tolti, ma siano stati posticipati al 2020 - ha spiegato l'assessore Gilmozzi - Se le risorse non arrivassero, ai Comuni è stata data la possibilità di utilizzare l'avanzo di bilancio. Non che la cosa ci faccia piacere, perché l'avanzo sono soldi nostri, non dello Stato\".\n\nL'assessore Gilmozzi si è soffermato anche sugli investimenti dei prossimi anni: dal restyling di piazza della Mostra alla nuova piscina, dal recupero dell'ex Atesina a quello dell'ex facoltà di Lettere, dal nuovo quartiere in viale dei Tigli ai numerosi interventi di manutenzione sul patrimonio edilizio esistente.\n\nI sindacati hanno invitato l'Amministrazione comunale a mantenere alta l'attenzione sulla sicurezza e sulla percezione della sicurezza da parte dei cittadini (Pomini) e sulle politiche di conciliazione per favorire il lavoro delle donne (Grosselli). Alotti ha sollecitato il sindaco ad aumentare la tassazione sulle case sfitte. E ancora Grosselli ha chiesto di mirare non solo alla riduzione dei costi ma anche alla tutela del lavoro negli appalti di servizi.","source":{"uri":"lavocedeltrentino.it","dataType":"news","title":"La Voce del Trentino Quotidiano online INDIPENDENTE"},"authors":[],"eventUri":null,"location":null},{"uri":"965790374","lang":"ita","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2018-10-10","time":"05:19:00","dateTime":"2018-10-10T05:19:00Z","dataType":"news","sim":0,"url":"https://www.lavocedeltrentino.it/2018/10/10/concluso-nel-migliore-dei-modi-lo-street-food-festival-levento-che-unisce-la-comunita-e-colora-le-strade/","title":"Concluso nel migliore dei modi lo Street Food Festival, l'evento che unisce la comunità e colora le strade - La voce del Trentino","body":"Si è conclusa domenica la terza edizione dello Street Food Festival, l'evento ha colorato le strade della città che, come sempre, sono state riempite dai profumi più disparati ed intriganti.\n\nSolo qualche giorno fa è stato celebrato un altro importante appuntamento, il Mercato Europeo. Anche qui, il cibo è stato l'assoluto protagonista dell'iniziativa che ha contato un significativo numero di visitatori.\n\nSapori italiani, sapori internazionali ed esotici hanno quindi conquistato la cittadinanza in un susseguirsi di appuntamenti \"appetitosi\".\n\nI truck che sono accorsi allo Street Food Festival, occupando il centro storico di Rovereto, si sono dimostrati dei veri e propri \"intrattenitori\", esponevano, oltre alle ricercate pietanze, la cultura del luogo che rappresentavano e questo, non può che considerarsi un valore aggiunto per una città che sta diventando sempre più all'avanguardia e internazionale.\n\nLa nascita dello street food (cibo da strada) risale a tempi antichissimi e, ancora oggi, è considerata una pratica di socializzazione, un momento di svago che ricorda il passato e la bellezza dello \"stare in paese\".\n\nAd aderire a questa edizione più di 20 furgoncini d'annata restaurati e colorati. Hanno partecipato Toscana, Veneto, Lazio, Calabria, Marche, Lombardia e molte altre regioni, ma, anche questa volta, i sapori esteri non potevano mancare; intramontabili i truck messicani, spagnoli e venezuelani.\n\nL' evento non si è però scemato dopo l'ora di cena.

The rest is not yet history as Gary Johnson, a former governor of New Mexico, seeks a seat in the U.S. Senate as a Libertarian and political wild card.\n\nJohnson says his high-desert home state of 2 million residents stands to gain considerable influence in the Senate if he is elected as a freewheeling swing vote -- possibly a decisive vote in the chamber, as Republicans defend a slim 51-49 majority in November elections.\n\nDemocrats are being forced to defend what had seemed like a secure seat for incumbent first-term Sen. Martin Heinrich, fending off Johnson's allure among voters as an uncompromising fiscal conservative with a quirky brand of free-market, pro-cannabis policies.\n\n\"Arguably if elected I would be the swing vote in the U.S. Senate, and that would be a big yank for New Mexico. It should benefit New Mexico in a really big way,\" Johnson tells a crowd of two dozen at a candidate forum in Tucumcari, near a string of abandoned highway-side motels, on the state's rural eastern plains.\n\nNationwide, Democrats are defending 26 incumbent Senate seats, while Republicans are defending only nine. The stakes in fall Senate races have been on dramatic display in Supreme Court confirmation proceedings amid accusations of sexual misconduct against nominee Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nJohnson says he would be a voice of common sense in the Senate and a rare nonpartisan vote during Supreme Court confirmation proceedings -- and an impartial judge in the event of a Senate impeachment trial against President Donald Trump, though he sees no impeachable offense so far.\n\nUntil then, Johnson applauds Trump's work at diminishing regulations, and denounces White House immigration policies as shameful and bad for the economy.\n\nThe real political crisis and looming threat to America's wellbeing, Johnson says, is runaway deficit spending. And the day of reckoning will come, according to Johnson, in the form of Venezuela-style inflation if the U.S. continues to spend beyond its means, on military and social programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.\n\n\"I applaud Trump on the tax cuts, but where is the spending reduction to go along with that,\" said Johnson, who wants to join the Senate Budget Committee that sets out Congress' broad blueprint for levels of federal revenues and spending.\n\nProminent Democrats say Johnson can't barge his way onto the committee, and they suspect he would readily collaborate to torpedo federal health care and nutritional subsidies that New Mexico relies on heavily.\n\nDede Feldman, a Democratic political strategist who served in the state Senate when Johnson was governor, questions Johnson's credentials as a voice of moderation, noting he was held in contempt as governor by the New Mexico Supreme Court for persisting with aggressive welfare changes without legislative approval.\n\nAt a community bank in Tucumcari, Johnson finds a receptive audience for his criticism of burdensome federal financial regulation in a meeting with the board of directors -- and some astonishment at his calls to decrease military spending by 23 percent, cut Medicare and retool Social Security.\n\n\"I'm 80 years old. I'm on Medicare, I receive Social Security, and I'm retired from the military,\" said Bill Curry, a board member at the Tucumcari Federal Savings and Loan Association, which was founded during the 1930s Great Depression. \"You've hit me on four different things.\"\n\nJohnson doesn't back down, cautioning social and retirement programs won't be around for future generations without prompt action.\n\nHe derides as a budget-buster his opponent Heinrich's support of \"Medicare-for-all\" legislation aimed at making strides toward universal health insurance coverage.\n\nHeinrich has cast himself as a defender of federal health and retirement benefits, and proponent of the new outdoor-recreation and renewable-energy economies -- a progressive hedge in an oil-based state economy.\n\nHeinrich, with youthful looks at age 46, has turned his committee appointments, including Armed Services, into a venue for expedient constituent politics in support of the New Mexico's military facilities and veterans.\n\nJohnson's answer to escalating medical costs is less regulation and even easing licensing requirement for medical professionals. His faith in free-market solutions with less regulation spills over into everything from oilfield methane emissions to public education, where Johnson supports government spending on independent schools through vouchers.\n\nPollsters and analysts see obstacles to Johnson building a quick coalition, after his late entry to the race in August.\n\n\"There are a lot of unaffiliated registered voters, but they tend to vote in half their numbers on low-turnout elections,\" said pollster Brian Sanderoff, of Research & Polling in Albuquerque. \"They're less likely to vote in nonpresidential election cycles.\"\n\nNew Mexico's Republican Party is calling Johnson a spoiler, saying he will draw votes from their candidate -- construction contractor and political newcomer Mick Rich -- playing directly into Democrats' hands.\n\nJohnson dismisses the GOP as a lost cause this year in New Mexico, which sided with Hillary Clinton in 2016 by a wide margin and twice backed Barack Obama.\n\n\"I do not think that a Republican can win a statewide race in New Mexico. I think that Trump has polluted those chances,\" he said.\n\nAs a Republican governor, Johnson vetoed more than 700 bills in perpetual standoffs with a Legislature run by Democrats, vetoing the entire budget in his final year only to have legislators override him. His advocacy as governor for marijuana legalization, beginning in 1999 when the stance was unpopular, still provides a political calling card -- one that Johnson says speaks to his honesty regardless of political consequences.\n\nCampaign disclosure filings show Johnson also is an investor in the nascent legal marijuana sector and a professional adviser to a cannabis hedge fund. He is a recreational user himself -- in a state that regulates medical marijuana access but still penalizes recreational cannabis.\n\nHeinrich, the Democrat, recently threw his support behind legalizing marijuana, while Johnson already is contemplating how to provide pardons for legions of drug-possession convicts.\n\nFor Johnson, a third act in politics at age 65 would mean setting aside a lifestyle of 100-day winter ski seasons and summer endurance bicycle rallies along the Continental Divide. Barnstorming through tiny towns to shake hands and deliver yard signs, Johnson said Trump has created the perfect storm for a Libertarian or truly independent candidate to join Congress and broker majority votes -- calling Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Angus King of Maine independents in name only.\n\nStopping unannounced at a barbecue stand at midday, Johnson ignites flickers of recognition and then conversations that often turn to his thoughts on cannabis.\n\n\"I love his policies,\" said Jace Alderson, 61, of Moriarty, recalling Johnson's hard-line stance against government spending as a Republican governor. \"It doesn't matter what party he is.\"","source":{"uri":"wral.com","dataType":"news","title":"WRAL.com"},"authors":[],"eventUri":null,"location":{"type":"place","label":{"eng":"Tucumcari, New Mexico"},"lat":35.17191,"long":-103.72686,"country":{"type":"country","label":{"eng":"United States"},"lat":39.76,"long":-98.5}}},{"uri":"965790356","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2018-10-10","time":"05:19:00","dateTime":"2018-10-10T05:19:00Z","dataType":"news","sim":0.6901960968971252,"url":"https://www.eurweb.com/2018/10/antonio-brown-sued-for-throwing-furniture-from-balcony-that-nearly-killed-toddler/","title":"Antonio Brown Sued for Throwing Furniture From Balcony That Nearly Killed Toddler","body":"According to TMZ, Brown snapped back in April and threw a bunch of furniture off the balcony of his 14th story luxury apartment, and some of it shattered near a 22-month-old baby.\n\nA lawsuit obtained by TMZ Sports states Antonio is being sued by Ophir Sternberg -- who claims it was his toddler son who was walking around the pool at the apartment complex with his grandfather when suddenly \"large objects started to fall from the building many floors above them.\"\n\nOTHER NEWS YOU MIGHT HAVE MISSED: Kanye West and Donald Trump Have a Lunch Date at the White House\n\nSternberg claims the items included: 2 very large vases, a heavy ottoman and other pieces of furniture.

Around midday it was expected to become one of the Panhandle's worst hurricanes in memory with 125 mph winds and a life-threatening storm surge of up to 13 feet (4 meters).\n\nFlorida officials said roughly 375,000 people up and down the Gulf Coast had been urged or ordered to evacuate. Evacuations spanned 22 counties from the Florida Panhandle into north central Florida. But fears lingered that some failed to heed the calls to get out of Michael's way as the hard-charging storm began speeding north over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nWorried meteorologists said it had the potential of becoming one of the worst storms in the history of Florida's Panhandle.\n\n\"I guess it's the worst case scenario. I don't think anyone would have experienced this in the Panhandle,\" meteorologist Ryan Maue of weathermodels.com told The Associated Press. \"This is going to have structure damaging winds along the coast and hurricane force winds inland.\"\n\nUniversity of Georgia's Marshall Shepherd, a former president of the American Meteorological Society, called it a \"life-altering event\" on Facebook and said he watched the storm's growth on satellite images with a pit growing in his stomach.\n\nFranklin County Sheriff A.J. Smith near the vulnerable coast said his deputies had gone door to door in some places urging people to evacuate. \"We have done everything we can as far as getting the word out,\" Smith said. \"Hopefully more people will leave.\"\n\nOn the exposed coast of Florida's Big Bend, most of the waterfront homes in Keaton Beach stood vacant amid fears of a life-threatening storm surge in an area that hadn't seen a potentially catastrophic major hurricane in decades. Even so, 77-year-old resident Robert Sadousky wasn't quite ready to evacuate yet.\n\nThe retired mill worker has spent more than half his life on the coast and weathered his share of storms. He chose the spot where his house stands on tall stilts overlooking the Gulf waters in 1972 after it was the only lot left dry after a storm flooded the beach that year.\n\nWhile most homes around him are vacation rentals or summer getaways for their owners, Sadousky had stayed put through more than four decades of storms. No longer. Michael was expected to bring surging seas up 9 feet (2.75 meters) above ground level at Keaton Beach.\n\n\"I know it's going to cover everything around here,\" Sadousky said Tuesday, eyeing water lapping at the edge of a canal behind his home. He pulled two small boat docks from the water, packed his pickup and picked some beans from his garden before getting out -- like hundreds of thousands elsewhere.\n\nAt 11 p.m. Tuesday, the eye of Michael was about 220 miles (355 kilometers) south-southwest of Panama City, Florida. It also was about 200 miles (325 kilometers) south-southwest of Apalachicola, Florida. But forecasters said winds and outer rain bands of a storm that was strengthening and becoming better organized by the hour would begin lashing the coast well ahead of the eye making landfall.\n\nMore than 180,000 people of those leaving were under mandatory evacuation orders, the long lines of cars jamming routes out Tuesday.\n\n\"We don't know if it's going to wipe out our house or not,\" Jason McDonald, of Panama City, said as he and his wife drove north to safety into Alabama with their two children, ages 5 and 7. \"We want to get them out of the way.\"\n\nFlorida Gov. Rick Scott warned it was a \"monstrous hurricane,\" and his Democratic opponent for the Senate, Sen. Bill Nelson, said a \"wall of water\" could cause destruction along the Panhandle.\n\n\"Don't think that you can ride this out if you're in a low-lying area,\" Nelson said on CNN.\n\nBut some officials were worried by what they weren't seeing -- a rush of evacuees.\n\n\"I am not seeing the level of traffic on the roadways that I would expect when we've called for the evacuation of 75 percent of this county,\" Bay County Sheriff Tommy Ford said.\n\nIn the dangerously exposed coastal town of Apalachicola, population 2,500, Sally Crown planned to go home and hunker down with her two dogs.\n\n\"We've been through this before,\" she said. \"This might be really bad and serious. But in my experience, it's always blown way out of proportion.\"\n\nMandatory evacuation orders went into effect in Panama City Beach and other low-lying areas in the storm's path. That included Pensacola Beach but not in Pensacola itself, a city of about 54,000.\n\nMichael could dump up to a foot (30 centimeters) of rain over some Panhandle communities before its remnants go back out to sea by way of the mid-Atlantic states over the next few days. Forecasters said it also could bring 3 to 6 inches of rain to Georgia, the Carolinas and Virginia, triggering flash flooding in a corner of the country still recovering from Florence. And isolated tornadoes were also possible.\n\nLush reported from St. Petersburg, Florida. Associated Press writers Russ Bynum in Keaton Beach, Florida, Jay Reeves in Panama City Beach, Florida, Jonathan Drew in Raleigh, North Carolina and Science Writer Seth Borenstein in Kensington, Maryland, contributed to this report.","source":{"uri":"wral.com","dataType":"news","title":"WRAL.com"},"authors":[],"eventUri":null,"location":null},{"uri":"965789282","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2018-10-10","time":"05:17:00","dateTime":"2018-10-10T05:17:00Z","dataType":"news","sim":0,"url":"http://volanteonline.com/2018/10/sga-senators-reflect-on-board-of-regents-meeting-last-tuesday/","title":"SGA senators reflect on Board of Regents meeting last Tuesday","body":"USD's Student Government Association resumed their weekly meetings after canceling last Tuesday's meeting in order to attend the Board of Regents meeting in Rapid City.\n\nSGA sent five members to the meeting, including SGA president Josh Sorbe, vice president Madison Green, office manager Amber Hulse, senator Matt Yetter and senator Christian Skunk.\n\nThe meeting was held in Rapid City at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology. Sorbe said the meeting was a valuable opportunity for Senate members to share their ideas with students involved in student government at other schools in the state.\n\n\"I think student federation is a good time for collaboration for student government associations across the state and to shoot ideas off of each other that we may be having and complications we might be having,\" Sorbe said. \"They are good people to bounce ideas off of because they are doing the same things we are doing just in different places.\"\n\nThe Board of Regents meeting covered a variety of topics including need-based financial aid, faculty salary competitiveness, Native American student enrollment and free speech policy revisions.\n\nSorbe said he found the first reading of the free speech policy an interesting point of discussion.\n\n\"They saw their first reading and it was approved to their second one where the Regents will most likely vote on the policy in December,\" Sorbe said. \"Outside of that, we also met South Dakota student federation out at Mines and there we discussed the Board of Regents priorities, which will be introduced in resolution from USD to student federation for all their agendas.\"\n\nSorbe and Green attended the meeting on behalf of USD, while the rest of the senators went on a volunteer basis. The Board of Regents meets every two months.\n\nSkunk said attending this meeting gave him an appreciation for USD's SGA.\n\n\"We should take pride in what we have as far as student government goes,\" Skunk said. \"If you look at the student federations at the School of Mines, their office is one room. We are very lucky here.\"\n\nAt this week's SGA meeting, the Senate relooked at five bills and one resolution. Three of the five bills were passed at this meeting. Senate Bill 78, which appropriates the budget for the Seldinger Society, Senate Bill 79, which approves the budget for the Philosophy club and Senate Bill 80 which appropriates the Math Club budget.\n\nThe other two bills, Senate Bill 76, which poses to change the SGA election dates and Senate Bill 77, which is on student organization recognition, will be brought back after going to internal reviews for the next meeting.\n\nSenate Resolution 6, which poses to change the MUC hours back to 2 a.m., was discussed and voted on, but it did not pass. Besides the discussion for this resolution, special guest Dan Dailey, Dean of Libraries, also addressed the Muenster University Center hours.\n\nDailey distributed a document of facts for the Senate to look at while he spoke. According to the document, I.D. Weeks Library originally began staying open till 2 a.m. in 2010. The dean of libraries and staff reviewed the policy again in 2014 and saw that there was the low utilization of the library, but decided to keep the policy as is.\n\nBefore the hour's change was made this school year, there was a thorough review of the current hours. Data was collected on the number of student present after midnight along with the use of computers after midnight.\n\n\"A very small fraction of those entries into I.D. Weeks happen after midnight during the weeknights,\" Daily said. \"I asked our staff to look at the utilization of I.D. Weeks after midnight, we dug into the statistics in 2017 and 2018. We've been as diligent as possible in terms of redirecting available dollars going towards the libraries.\"","source":{"uri":"volanteonline.com","dataType":"news","title":"The Volante"},"authors":[{"uri":"lexi_kerzman@volanteonline.com","name":"Lexi Kerzman","type":"author","isAgency":false}],"eventUri":null,"location":null},{"uri":"965790355","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2018-10-10","time":"05:19:00","dateTime":"2018-10-10T05:19:00Z","dataType":"news","sim":0,"url":"https://www.eurweb.com/2018/10/kevin-hart-saw-two-women-sht-on-themselves-during-chicago-marathon-watch/","title":"Kevin Hart Saw Two Women Poop on Themselves During Chicago Marathon [WATCH]","body":"[display-posts wrapper=\"div\" wrapper_class=\"my-grid-layout\" category=\"trending-news\" posts_per_page=\"3\" include_title=\"true\" include_link=\"false\" include_date=\"true\" date_format=\"F j, Y\" image_size=\"large\" trending_posts=\"true\"]\n\n*After some inspirational words of advice, Kevin Hart finished strong at the 2018 Bank of America Chicago Marathon on Sunday (Oct. 7).\n\nThe comedian announced in August that he would be running the iconic marathon, with hopes of beating his time from last year's New York City Marathon.\n\nHart posted a video on Instagram early Thursday of himself on Chicago's Lakefront Trail, sharing his reason for participating in the race.\n\n\"I told you guys I put a purpose behind the run. In other words, there's a meaning, there's a definition, there's a reason,\" he said. \"The reason behind this run is simply first and foremost personal greatness, personal achievement but also what I can bring awareness to, what I can raise money for,\" he continued before shouting, \"Education!\"\n\nOTHER NEWS YOU MIGHT HAVE MISSED: Blac Chyna A SlutWalk No-show (She & Amber UNfollow Each Other)\n\nKevin also shared a video after crossing the finish line Sunday, and even though he was disappointed in his time, he was happy he participated.\n\nAs reported by The Blast, Hart, who finished 18,057 with a time of 4:13:10, says he broke down hard at mile 22 with cramps that felt like \"Someone shot me in my ass, calf, and hamstring.\"\n\nHe said sh*t got real when he \"Saw two older women sh*t on themselves,\" including one woman who popped a squat in front of everyone and just \"Moved her shorts to the side.\"\n\nWatch him explain it via the clip above.\n\nMeanwhile, reviews have been largely negative for his latest movie \"Night School\" but for Kevin, it's the fan's opinions that matter most, as he recently explained:\n\n\"It's been so positive from the fans.

Well, he's in that space again because the man who says he was assaulted by Williams last Friday in Portland is suing the funnyman for $76,000.\n\nHis lawyer says the money is for his physical injuries and emotional distress. The alleged victim's name is Wali Kanani and he's the owner of Delta Town Car Service in Portland.\n\nKanani was picking up Williams, his German Shepherd, and his colleagues at a private hanger of the airport, reports Fox12.\n\nThe complaint, filed Monday, states Williams insisted his dog sit in the front seat, and Kanani said no.\n\nThe document outlines what happened from there. It alleges Williams called Kanani names like \"white trash,\" then punched him in the face.\n\nKanani ran inside to get away and Williams reportedly \"commanded his dog to start chasing\" him, according to court documents.\n\n\"This is totally inappropriate behavior and there has to be some sort of deterrent effect above and beyond what the lawsuit itself would bring,\" Kanani's attorney Adam Heder said.\n\nThat's why Heder filed the complaint now asking for $76,000 plus medical costs.\n\nREAD THIS/BLIND ITEM: HIS 'GIRLFRIEND' IS PRETTY MUCH AN AFTERTHOUGHT\n\nThe article goes on to say that Attorney Heder wouldn't provide photos of Kanani's injuries, but said he had cuts and swelling on his face, a broken tooth and tinnitus in one ear, as well as what he's suffered emotionally.\n\n\"You can imagine in the course of doing your job getting struck in the face in this aggressive and belligerent manner can cause a tremendous amount of emotional distress to even the best of us,\" Heder said.\n\nAs far as what's happening with Williams in court, on Monday he had a hearing on the charge of assault in the fourth degree. The judge apparently wasn't impressed and he was released on that charge. However, the judge ordered him to stay away from Kanani (but now Kanani is suing him).\n\nSo, even though Williams doesn't have to worry about that charge, as we've reported, he's is still in lockdown in Portland because he's wanted in Georgia","source":{"uri":"eurweb.com","dataType":"news","title":"EURweb"},"authors":[],"eventUri":null,"location":null},{"uri":"965790367","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2018-10-10","time":"05:19:00","dateTime":"2018-10-10T05:19:00Z","dataType":"news","sim":0.6313725709915161,"url":"https://www.mediaite.com/tv/don-lemon-people-harassing-ted-cruz-at-restaurant-wasnt-mob-behavior-its-people-who-are-upset/","title":"Don Lemon: People Harassing Ted Cruz at Restaurant Wasn't 'Mob Behavior,' It's 'People Who Are Upset'","body":"CNN host Don Lemon took a similar stance with his colleague Brooke Baldwin about what defines a mob.\n\nEarlier in the day, Daily Beast columnist Matt Lewis argued that the anti-Kavanaugh protestors who harassed Sen.

Dall'Imis al fondo perequativo, dai nidi al trasporto pubblico, in assenza di informazioni abbiamo dovuto confermare i numeri dell'anno scorso\".\n\nLa proposta di bilancio completa sarà depositata il 15 novembre, un mese prima della discussione in aula.\n\nCome avviene ormai da svariati anni, tutti i Servizi comunali sono stati invitati a ridurre la spesa corrente e a calibrare bene le previsioni, in modo da non generare avanzo. Per quanto riguarda i contenuti della manovra, il sindaco ha sottolineato l'invarianza delle tariffe (\"al massimo ci sarà un adeguamento al tasso di inflazione programmata\"), l'aumento delle risorse per i lavori socialmente utili e per il turismo: \"E' un settore che tira - ha spiegato Andreatta - Quest'anno poi è andato particolarmente bene grazie alla concentrazione di grandi eventi ospitati in città\".\n\nMassima attenzione anche al sociale, con l'aumento (costante in questi anni) delle voci per l'integrazione dell'affitto e per supportare le famiglie più fragili. Naturalmente in primo piano resta anche il capitolo sicurezza, che prevede tra l'altro la sostituzione di tutti gli agenti che andranno in pensione e il rafforzamento della squadra aggiuntiva della polizia municipale, che diventa stabile e non più a termine come ai suoi esordi.\n\nTra i temi del confronto, pure il bando Periferie e il nodo dei 18 milioni di euro prima confermati e poi messi in dubbio dal governo nazionale: \"Pare che i fondi non ci siano stati tolti, ma siano stati posticipati al 2020 - ha spiegato l'assessore Gilmozzi - Se le risorse non arrivassero, ai Comuni è stata data la possibilità di utilizzare l'avanzo di bilancio. Non che la cosa ci faccia piacere, perché l'avanzo sono soldi nostri, non dello Stato\".\n\nL'assessore Gilmozzi si è soffermato anche sugli investimenti dei prossimi anni: dal restyling di piazza della Mostra alla nuova piscina, dal recupero dell'ex Atesina a quello dell'ex facoltà di Lettere, dal nuovo quartiere in viale dei Tigli ai numerosi interventi di manutenzione sul patrimonio edilizio esistente.\n\nI sindacati hanno invitato l'Amministrazione comunale a mantenere alta l'attenzione sulla sicurezza e sulla percezione della sicurezza da parte dei cittadini (Pomini) e sulle politiche di conciliazione per favorire il lavoro delle donne (Grosselli). Alotti ha sollecitato il sindaco ad aumentare la tassazione sulle case sfitte. E ancora Grosselli ha chiesto di mirare non solo alla riduzione dei costi ma anche alla tutela del lavoro negli appalti di servizi.","source":{"uri":"lavocedeltrentino.it","dataType":"news","title":"La Voce del Trentino Quotidiano online INDIPENDENTE"},"authors":[],"eventUri":null,"location":null},{"uri":"965790374","lang":"ita","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2018-10-10","time":"05:19:00","dateTime":"2018-10-10T05:19:00Z","dataType":"news","sim":0,"url":"https://www.lavocedeltrentino.it/2018/10/10/concluso-nel-migliore-dei-modi-lo-street-food-festival-levento-che-unisce-la-comunita-e-colora-le-strade/","title":"Concluso nel migliore dei modi lo Street Food Festival, l'evento che unisce la comunità e colora le strade - La voce del Trentino","body":"Si è conclusa domenica la terza edizione dello Street Food Festival, l'evento ha colorato le strade della città che, come sempre, sono state riempite dai profumi più disparati ed intriganti.\n\nSolo qualche giorno fa è stato celebrato un altro importante appuntamento, il Mercato Europeo. Anche qui, il cibo è stato l'assoluto protagonista dell'iniziativa che ha contato un significativo numero di visitatori.\n\nSapori italiani, sapori internazionali ed esotici hanno quindi conquistato la cittadinanza in un susseguirsi di appuntamenti \"appetitosi\".\n\nI truck che sono accorsi allo Street Food Festival, occupando il centro storico di Rovereto, si sono dimostrati dei veri e propri \"intrattenitori\", esponevano, oltre alle ricercate pietanze, la cultura del luogo che rappresentavano e questo, non può che considerarsi un valore aggiunto per una città che sta diventando sempre più all'avanguardia e internazionale.\n\nLa nascita dello street food (cibo da strada) risale a tempi antichissimi e, ancora oggi, è considerata una pratica di socializzazione, un momento di svago che ricorda il passato e la bellezza dello \"stare in paese\".\n\nAd aderire a questa edizione più di 20 furgoncini d'annata restaurati e colorati. Hanno partecipato Toscana, Veneto, Lazio, Calabria, Marche, Lombardia e molte altre regioni, ma, anche questa volta, i sapori esteri non potevano mancare; intramontabili i truck messicani, spagnoli e venezuelani.\n\nL' evento non si è però scemato dopo l'ora di cena.

The rest is not yet history as Gary Johnson, a former governor of New Mexico, seeks a seat in the U.S. Senate as a Libertarian and political wild card.\n\nJohnson says his high-desert home state of 2 million residents stands to gain considerable influence in the Senate if he is elected as a freewheeling swing vote -- possibly a decisive vote in the chamber, as Republicans defend a slim 51-49 majority in November elections.\n\nDemocrats are being forced to defend what had seemed like a secure seat for incumbent first-term Sen. Martin Heinrich, fending off Johnson's allure among voters as an uncompromising fiscal conservative with a quirky brand of free-market, pro-cannabis policies.\n\n\"Arguably if elected I would be the swing vote in the U.S. Senate, and that would be a big yank for New Mexico. It should benefit New Mexico in a really big way,\" Johnson tells a crowd of two dozen at a candidate forum in Tucumcari, near a string of abandoned highway-side motels, on the state's rural eastern plains.\n\nNationwide, Democrats are defending 26 incumbent Senate seats, while Republicans are defending only nine. The stakes in fall Senate races have been on dramatic display in Supreme Court confirmation proceedings amid accusations of sexual misconduct against nominee Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nJohnson says he would be a voice of common sense in the Senate and a rare nonpartisan vote during Supreme Court confirmation proceedings -- and an impartial judge in the event of a Senate impeachment trial against President Donald Trump, though he sees no impeachable offense so far.\n\nUntil then, Johnson applauds Trump's work at diminishing regulations, and denounces White House immigration policies as shameful and bad for the economy.\n\nThe real political crisis and looming threat to America's wellbeing, Johnson says, is runaway deficit spending. And the day of reckoning will come, according to Johnson, in the form of Venezuela-style inflation if the U.S. continues to spend beyond its means, on military and social programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.\n\n\"I applaud Trump on the tax cuts, but where is the spending reduction to go along with that,\" said Johnson, who wants to join the Senate Budget Committee that sets out Congress' broad blueprint for levels of federal revenues and spending.\n\nProminent Democrats say Johnson can't barge his way onto the committee, and they suspect he would readily collaborate to torpedo federal health care and nutritional subsidies that New Mexico relies on heavily.\n\nDede Feldman, a Democratic political strategist who served in the state Senate when Johnson was governor, questions Johnson's credentials as a voice of moderation, noting he was held in contempt as governor by the New Mexico Supreme Court for persisting with aggressive welfare changes without legislative approval.\n\nAt a community bank in Tucumcari, Johnson finds a receptive audience for his criticism of burdensome federal financial regulation in a meeting with the board of directors -- and some astonishment at his calls to decrease military spending by 23 percent, cut Medicare and retool Social Security.\n\n\"I'm 80 years old. I'm on Medicare, I receive Social Security, and I'm retired from the military,\" said Bill Curry, a board member at the Tucumcari Federal Savings and Loan Association, which was founded during the 1930s Great Depression. \"You've hit me on four different things.\"\n\nJohnson doesn't back down, cautioning social and retirement programs won't be around for future generations without prompt action.\n\nHe derides as a budget-buster his opponent Heinrich's support of \"Medicare-for-all\" legislation aimed at making strides toward universal health insurance coverage.\n\nHeinrich has cast himself as a defender of federal health and retirement benefits, and proponent of the new outdoor-recreation and renewable-energy economies -- a progressive hedge in an oil-based state economy.\n\nHeinrich, with youthful looks at age 46, has turned his committee appointments, including Armed Services, into a venue for expedient constituent politics in support of the New Mexico's military facilities and veterans.\n\nJohnson's answer to escalating medical costs is less regulation and even easing licensing requirement for medical professionals. His faith in free-market solutions with less regulation spills over into everything from oilfield methane emissions to public education, where Johnson supports government spending on independent schools through vouchers.\n\nPollsters and analysts see obstacles to Johnson building a quick coalition, after his late entry to the race in August.\n\n\"There are a lot of unaffiliated registered voters, but they tend to vote in half their numbers on low-turnout elections,\" said pollster Brian Sanderoff, of Research & Polling in Albuquerque. \"They're less likely to vote in nonpresidential election cycles.\"\n\nNew Mexico's Republican Party is calling Johnson a spoiler, saying he will draw votes from their candidate -- construction contractor and political newcomer Mick Rich -- playing directly into Democrats' hands.\n\nJohnson dismisses the GOP as a lost cause this year in New Mexico, which sided with Hillary Clinton in 2016 by a wide margin and twice backed Barack Obama.\n\n\"I do not think that a Republican can win a statewide race in New Mexico. I think that Trump has polluted those chances,\" he said.\n\nAs a Republican governor, Johnson vetoed more than 700 bills in perpetual standoffs with a Legislature run by Democrats, vetoing the entire budget in his final year only to have legislators override him. His advocacy as governor for marijuana legalization, beginning in 1999 when the stance was unpopular, still provides a political calling card -- one that Johnson says speaks to his honesty regardless of political consequences.\n\nCampaign disclosure filings show Johnson also is an investor in the nascent legal marijuana sector and a professional adviser to a cannabis hedge fund. He is a recreational user himself -- in a state that regulates medical marijuana access but still penalizes recreational cannabis.\n\nHeinrich, the Democrat, recently threw his support behind legalizing marijuana, while Johnson already is contemplating how to provide pardons for legions of drug-possession convicts.\n\nFor Johnson, a third act in politics at age 65 would mean setting aside a lifestyle of 100-day winter ski seasons and summer endurance bicycle rallies along the Continental Divide. Barnstorming through tiny towns to shake hands and deliver yard signs, Johnson said Trump has created the perfect storm for a Libertarian or truly independent candidate to join Congress and broker majority votes -- calling Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Angus King of Maine independents in name only.\n\nStopping unannounced at a barbecue stand at midday, Johnson ignites flickers of recognition and then conversations that often turn to his thoughts on cannabis.\n\n\"I love his policies,\" said Jace Alderson, 61, of Moriarty, recalling Johnson's hard-line stance against government spending as a Republican governor. \"It doesn't matter what party he is.\"","source":{"uri":"wral.com","dataType":"news","title":"WRAL.com"},"authors":[],"eventUri":null,"location":{"type":"place","label":{"eng":"Tucumcari, New Mexico"},"lat":35.17191,"long":-103.72686,"country":{"type":"country","label":{"eng":"United States"},"lat":39.76,"long":-98.5}}},{"uri":"965790356","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2018-10-10","time":"05:19:00","dateTime":"2018-10-10T05:19:00Z","dataType":"news","sim":0.6901960968971252,"url":"https://www.eurweb.com/2018/10/antonio-brown-sued-for-throwing-furniture-from-balcony-that-nearly-killed-toddler/","title":"Antonio Brown Sued for Throwing Furniture From Balcony That Nearly Killed Toddler","body":"According to TMZ, Brown snapped back in April and threw a bunch of furniture off the balcony of his 14th story luxury apartment, and some of it shattered near a 22-month-old baby.\n\nA lawsuit obtained by TMZ Sports states Antonio is being sued by Ophir Sternberg -- who claims it was his toddler son who was walking around the pool at the apartment complex with his grandfather when suddenly \"large objects started to fall from the building many floors above them.\"\n\nOTHER NEWS YOU MIGHT HAVE MISSED: Kanye West and Donald Trump Have a Lunch Date at the White House\n\nSternberg claims the items included: 2 very large vases, a heavy ottoman and other pieces of furniture.

Around midday it was expected to become one of the Panhandle's worst hurricanes in memory with 125 mph winds and a life-threatening storm surge of up to 13 feet (4 meters).\n\nFlorida officials said roughly 375,000 people up and down the Gulf Coast had been urged or ordered to evacuate. Evacuations spanned 22 counties from the Florida Panhandle into north central Florida. But fears lingered that some failed to heed the calls to get out of Michael's way as the hard-charging storm began speeding north over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nWorried meteorologists said it had the potential of becoming one of the worst storms in the history of Florida's Panhandle.\n\n\"I guess it's the worst case scenario. I don't think anyone would have experienced this in the Panhandle,\" meteorologist Ryan Maue of weathermodels.com told The Associated Press. \"This is going to have structure damaging winds along the coast and hurricane force winds inland.\"\n\nUniversity of Georgia's Marshall Shepherd, a former president of the American Meteorological Society, called it a \"life-altering event\" on Facebook and said he watched the storm's growth on satellite images with a pit growing in his stomach.\n\nFranklin County Sheriff A.J. Smith near the vulnerable coast said his deputies had gone door to door in some places urging people to evacuate. \"We have done everything we can as far as getting the word out,\" Smith said. \"Hopefully more people will leave.\"\n\nOn the exposed coast of Florida's Big Bend, most of the waterfront homes in Keaton Beach stood vacant amid fears of a life-threatening storm surge in an area that hadn't seen a potentially catastrophic major hurricane in decades. Even so, 77-year-old resident Robert Sadousky wasn't quite ready to evacuate yet.\n\nThe retired mill worker has spent more than half his life on the coast and weathered his share of storms. He chose the spot where his house stands on tall stilts overlooking the Gulf waters in 1972 after it was the only lot left dry after a storm flooded the beach that year.\n\nWhile most homes around him are vacation rentals or summer getaways for their owners, Sadousky had stayed put through more than four decades of storms. No longer. Michael was expected to bring surging seas up 9 feet (2.75 meters) above ground level at Keaton Beach.\n\n\"I know it's going to cover everything around here,\" Sadousky said Tuesday, eyeing water lapping at the edge of a canal behind his home. He pulled two small boat docks from the water, packed his pickup and picked some beans from his garden before getting out -- like hundreds of thousands elsewhere.\n\nAt 11 p.m. Tuesday, the eye of Michael was about 220 miles (355 kilometers) south-southwest of Panama City, Florida. It also was about 200 miles (325 kilometers) south-southwest of Apalachicola, Florida. But forecasters said winds and outer rain bands of a storm that was strengthening and becoming better organized by the hour would begin lashing the coast well ahead of the eye making landfall.\n\nMore than 180,000 people of those leaving were under mandatory evacuation orders, the long lines of cars jamming routes out Tuesday.\n\n\"We don't know if it's going to wipe out our house or not,\" Jason McDonald, of Panama City, said as he and his wife drove north to safety into Alabama with their two children, ages 5 and 7. \"We want to get them out of the way.\"\n\nFlorida Gov. Rick Scott warned it was a \"monstrous hurricane,\" and his Democratic opponent for the Senate, Sen. Bill Nelson, said a \"wall of water\" could cause destruction along the Panhandle.\n\n\"Don't think that you can ride this out if you're in a low-lying area,\" Nelson said on CNN.\n\nBut some officials were worried by what they weren't seeing -- a rush of evacuees.\n\n\"I am not seeing the level of traffic on the roadways that I would expect when we've called for the evacuation of 75 percent of this county,\" Bay County Sheriff Tommy Ford said.\n\nIn the dangerously exposed coastal town of Apalachicola, population 2,500, Sally Crown planned to go home and hunker down with her two dogs.\n\n\"We've been through this before,\" she said. \"This might be really bad and serious. But in my experience, it's always blown way out of proportion.\"\n\nMandatory evacuation orders went into effect in Panama City Beach and other low-lying areas in the storm's path. That included Pensacola Beach but not in Pensacola itself, a city of about 54,000.\n\nMichael could dump up to a foot (30 centimeters) of rain over some Panhandle communities before its remnants go back out to sea by way of the mid-Atlantic states over the next few days. Forecasters said it also could bring 3 to 6 inches of rain to Georgia, the Carolinas and Virginia, triggering flash flooding in a corner of the country still recovering from Florence. And isolated tornadoes were also possible.\n\nLush reported from St. Petersburg, Florida.

Sorbe said the meeting was a valuable opportunity for Senate members to share their ideas with students involved in student government at other schools in the state.\n\n\"I think student federation is a good time for collaboration for student government associations across the state and to shoot ideas off of each other that we may be having and complications we might be having,\" Sorbe said. \"They are good people to bounce ideas off of because they are doing the same things we are doing just in different places.\"\n\nThe Board of Regents meeting covered a variety of topics including need-based financial aid, faculty salary competitiveness, Native American student enrollment and free speech policy revisions.\n\nSorbe said he found the first reading of the free speech policy an interesting point of discussion.\n\n\"They saw their first reading and it was approved to their second one where the Regents will most likely vote on the policy in December,\" Sorbe said. \"Outside of that, we also met South Dakota student federation out at Mines and there we discussed the Board of Regents priorities, which will be introduced in resolution from USD to student federation for all their agendas.\"\n\nSorbe and Green attended the meeting on behalf of USD, while the rest of the senators went on a volunteer basis. The Board of Regents meets every two months.\n\nSkunk said attending this meeting gave him an appreciation for USD's SGA.\n\n\"We should take pride in what we have as far as student government goes,\" Skunk said. \"If you look at the student federations at the School of Mines, their office is one room. We are very lucky here.\"\n\nAt this week's SGA meeting, the Senate relooked at five bills and one resolution. Three of the five bills were passed at this meeting. Senate Bill 78, which appropriates the budget for the Seldinger Society, Senate Bill 79, which approves the budget for the Philosophy club and Senate Bill 80 which appropriates the Math Club budget.\n\nThe other two bills, Senate Bill 76, which poses to change the SGA election dates and Senate Bill 77, which is on student organization recognition, will be brought back after going to internal reviews for the next meeting.\n\nSenate Resolution 6, which poses to change the MUC hours back to 2 a.m., was discussed and voted on, but it did not pass. Besides the discussion for this resolution, special guest Dan Dailey, Dean of Libraries, also addressed the Muenster University Center hours.\n\nDailey distributed a document of facts for the Senate to look at while he spoke. According to the document, I.D. Weeks Library originally began staying open till 2 a.m. in 2010. The dean of libraries and staff reviewed the policy again in 2014 and saw that there was the low utilization of the library, but decided to keep the policy as is.\n\nBefore the hour's change was made this school year, there was a thorough review of the current hours. Data was collected on the number of student present after midnight along with the use of computers after midnight.\n\n\"A very small fraction of those entries into I.D. Weeks happen after midnight during the weeknights,\" Daily said. \"I asked our staff to look at the utilization of I.D. Weeks after midnight, we dug into the statistics in 2017 and 2018.

In other words, there's a meaning, there's a definition, there's a reason,\" he said. \"The reason behind this run is simply first and foremost personal greatness, personal achievement but also what I can bring awareness to, what I can raise money for,\" he continued before shouting, \"Education!\"\n\nOTHER NEWS YOU MIGHT HAVE MISSED: Blac Chyna A SlutWalk No-show (She & Amber UNfollow Each Other)\n\nKevin also shared a video after crossing the finish line Sunday, and even though he was disappointed in his time, he was happy he participated.\n\nAs reported by The Blast, Hart, who finished 18,057 with a time of 4:13:10, says he broke down hard at mile 22 with cramps that felt like \"Someone shot me in my ass, calf, and hamstring.\"\n\nHe said sh*t got real when he \"Saw two older women sh*t on themselves,\" including one woman who popped a squat in front of everyone and just \"Moved her shorts to the side.\"\n\nWatch him explain it via the clip above.\n\nMeanwhile, reviews have been largely negative for his latest movie \"Night School\" but for Kevin, it's the fan's opinions that matter most, as he recently explained:\n\n\"It's been so positive from the fans.

Well, he's in that space again because the man who says he was assaulted by Williams last Friday in Portland is suing the funnyman for $76,000.\n\nHis lawyer says the money is for his physical injuries and emotional distress. The alleged victim's name is Wali Kanani and he's the owner of Delta Town Car Service in Portland.\n\nKanani was picking up Williams, his German Shepherd, and his colleagues at a private hanger of the airport, reports Fox12.\n\nThe complaint, filed Monday, states Williams insisted his dog sit in the front seat, and Kanani said no.\n\nThe document outlines what happened from there. It alleges Williams called Kanani names like \"white trash,\" then punched him in the face.\n\nKanani ran inside to get away and Williams reportedly \"commanded his dog to start chasing\" him, according to court documents.\n\n\"This is totally inappropriate behavior and there has to be some sort of deterrent effect above and beyond what the lawsuit itself would bring,\" Kanani's attorney Adam Heder said.\n\nThat's why Heder filed the complaint now asking for $76,000 plus medical costs.\n\nREAD THIS/BLIND ITEM: HIS 'GIRLFRIEND' IS PRETTY MUCH AN AFTERTHOUGHT\n\nThe article goes on to say that Attorney Heder wouldn't provide photos of Kanani's injuries, but said he had cuts and swelling on his face, a broken tooth and tinnitus in one ear, as well as what he's suffered emotionally.\n\n\"You can imagine in the course of doing your job getting struck in the face in this aggressive and belligerent manner can cause a tremendous amount of emotional distress to even the best of us,\" Heder said.\n\nAs far as what's happening with Williams in court, on Monday he had a hearing on the charge of assault in the fourth degree. The judge apparently wasn't impressed and he was released on that charge. However, the judge ordered him to stay away from Kanani (but now Kanani is suing him).\n\nSo, even though Williams doesn't have to worry about that charge, as we've reported, he's is still in lockdown in Portland because he's wanted in Georgia","source":{"uri":"eurweb.com","dataType":"news","title":"EURweb"},"authors":[],"eventUri":null,"location":null},{"uri":"965790367","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2018-10-10","time":"05:19:00","dateTime":"2018-10-10T05:19:00Z","dataType":"news","sim":0.6313725709915161,"url":"https://www.mediaite.com/tv/don-lemon-people-harassing-ted-cruz-at-restaurant-wasnt-mob-behavior-its-people-who-are-upset/","title":"Don Lemon: People Harassing Ted Cruz at Restaurant Wasn't 'Mob Behavior,' It's 'People Who Are Upset'","body":"CNN host Don Lemon took a similar stance with his colleague Brooke Baldwin about what defines a mob.\n\nEarlier in the day, Daily Beast columnist Matt Lewis argued that the anti-Kavanaugh protestors who harassed Sen.

Dall'Imis al fondo perequativo, dai nidi al trasporto pubblico, in assenza di informazioni abbiamo dovuto confermare i numeri dell'anno scorso\".\n\nLa proposta di bilancio completa sarà depositata il 15 novembre, un mese prima della discussione in aula.\n\nCome avviene ormai da svariati anni, tutti i Servizi comunali sono stati invitati a ridurre la spesa corrente e a calibrare bene le previsioni, in modo da non generare avanzo. Per quanto riguarda i contenuti della manovra, il sindaco ha sottolineato l'invarianza delle tariffe (\"al massimo ci sarà un adeguamento al tasso di inflazione programmata\"), l'aumento delle risorse per i lavori socialmente utili e per il turismo: \"E' un settore che tira - ha spiegato Andreatta - Quest'anno poi è andato particolarmente bene grazie alla concentrazione di grandi eventi ospitati in città\".\n\nMassima attenzione anche al sociale, con l'aumento (costante in questi anni) delle voci per l'integrazione dell'affitto e per supportare le famiglie più fragili. Naturalmente in primo piano resta anche il capitolo sicurezza, che prevede tra l'altro la sostituzione di tutti gli agenti che andranno in pensione e il rafforzamento della squadra aggiuntiva della polizia municipale, che diventa stabile e non più a termine come ai suoi esordi.\n\nTra i temi del confronto, pure il bando Periferie e il nodo dei 18 milioni di euro prima confermati e poi messi in dubbio dal governo nazionale: \"Pare che i fondi non ci siano stati tolti, ma siano stati posticipati al 2020 - ha spiegato l'assessore Gilmozzi - Se le risorse non arrivassero, ai Comuni è stata data la possibilità di utilizzare l'avanzo di bilancio. Non che la cosa ci faccia piacere, perché l'avanzo sono soldi nostri, non dello Stato\".\n\nL'assessore Gilmozzi si è soffermato anche sugli investimenti dei prossimi anni: dal restyling di piazza della Mostra alla nuova piscina, dal recupero dell'ex Atesina a quello dell'ex facoltà di Lettere, dal nuovo quartiere in viale dei Tigli ai numerosi interventi di manutenzione sul patrimonio edilizio esistente.\n\nI sindacati hanno invitato l'Amministrazione comunale a mantenere alta l'attenzione sulla sicurezza e sulla percezione della sicurezza da parte dei cittadini (Pomini) e sulle politiche di conciliazione per favorire il lavoro delle donne (Grosselli). Alotti ha sollecitato il sindaco ad aumentare la tassazione sulle case sfitte. E ancora Grosselli ha chiesto di mirare non solo alla riduzione dei costi ma anche alla tutela del lavoro negli appalti di servizi.","source":{"uri":"lavocedeltrentino.it","dataType":"news","title":"La Voce del Trentino Quotidiano online INDIPENDENTE"},"authors":[],"eventUri":null,"location":null},{"uri":"965790374","lang":"ita","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2018-10-10","time":"05:19:00","dateTime":"2018-10-10T05:19:00Z","dataType":"news","sim":0,"url":"https://www.lavocedeltrentino.it/2018/10/10/concluso-nel-migliore-dei-modi-lo-street-food-festival-levento-che-unisce-la-comunita-e-colora-le-strade/","title":"Concluso nel migliore dei modi lo Street Food Festival, l'evento che unisce la comunità e colora le strade - La voce del Trentino","body":"Si è conclusa domenica la terza edizione dello Street Food Festival, l'evento ha colorato le strade della città che, come sempre, sono state riempite dai profumi più disparati ed intriganti.\n\nSolo qualche giorno fa è stato celebrato un altro importante appuntamento, il Mercato Europeo.

The rest is not yet history as Gary Johnson, a former governor of New Mexico, seeks a seat in the U.S. Senate as a Libertarian and political wild card.\n\nJohnson says his high-desert home state of 2 million residents stands to gain considerable influence in the Senate if he is elected as a freewheeling swing vote -- possibly a decisive vote in the chamber, as Republicans defend a slim 51-49 majority in November elections.\n\nDemocrats are being forced to defend what had seemed like a secure seat for incumbent first-term Sen. Martin Heinrich, fending off Johnson's allure among voters as an uncompromising fiscal conservative with a quirky brand of free-market, pro-cannabis policies.\n\n\"Arguably if elected I would be the swing vote in the U.S. Senate, and that would be a big yank for New Mexico. It should benefit New Mexico in a really big way,\" Johnson tells a crowd of two dozen at a candidate forum in Tucumcari, near a string of abandoned highway-side motels, on the state's rural eastern plains.\n\nNationwide, Democrats are defending 26 incumbent Senate seats, while Republicans are defending only nine. The stakes in fall Senate races have been on dramatic display in Supreme Court confirmation proceedings amid accusations of sexual misconduct against nominee Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nJohnson says he would be a voice of common sense in the Senate and a rare nonpartisan vote during Supreme Court confirmation proceedings -- and an impartial judge in the event of a Senate impeachment trial against President Donald Trump, though he sees no impeachable offense so far.\n\nUntil then, Johnson applauds Trump's work at diminishing regulations, and denounces White House immigration policies as shameful and bad for the economy.\n\nThe real political crisis and looming threat to America's wellbeing, Johnson says, is runaway deficit spending. And the day of reckoning will come, according to Johnson, in the form of Venezuela-style inflation if the U.S. continues to spend beyond its means, on military and social programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.\n\n\"I applaud Trump on the tax cuts, but where is the spending reduction to go along with that,\" said Johnson, who wants to join the Senate Budget Committee that sets out Congress' broad blueprint for levels of federal revenues and spending.\n\nProminent Democrats say Johnson can't barge his way onto the committee, and they suspect he would readily collaborate to torpedo federal health care and nutritional subsidies that New Mexico relies on heavily.\n\nDede Feldman, a Democratic political strategist who served in the state Senate when Johnson was governor, questions Johnson's credentials as a voice of moderation, noting he was held in contempt as governor by the New Mexico Supreme Court for persisting with aggressive welfare changes without legislative approval.\n\nAt a community bank in Tucumcari, Johnson finds a receptive audience for his criticism of burdensome federal financial regulation in a meeting with the board of directors -- and some astonishment at his calls to decrease military spending by 23 percent, cut Medicare and retool Social Security.\n\n\"I'm 80 years old. I'm on Medicare, I receive Social Security, and I'm retired from the military,\" said Bill Curry, a board member at the Tucumcari Federal Savings and Loan Association, which was founded during the 1930s Great Depression. \"You've hit me on four different things.\"\n\nJohnson doesn't back down, cautioning social and retirement programs won't be around for future generations without prompt action.\n\nHe derides as a budget-buster his opponent Heinrich's support of \"Medicare-for-all\" legislation aimed at making strides toward universal health insurance coverage.\n\nHeinrich has cast himself as a defender of federal health and retirement benefits, and proponent of the new outdoor-recreation and renewable-energy economies -- a progressive hedge in an oil-based state economy.\n\nHeinrich, with youthful looks at age 46, has turned his committee appointments, including Armed Services, into a venue for expedient constituent politics in support of the New Mexico's military facilities and veterans.\n\nJohnson's answer to escalating medical costs is less regulation and even easing licensing requirement for medical professionals. His faith in free-market solutions with less regulation spills over into everything from oilfield methane emissions to public education, where Johnson supports government spending on independent schools through vouchers.\n\nPollsters and analysts see obstacles to Johnson building a quick coalition, after his late entry to the race in August.\n\n\"There are a lot of unaffiliated registered voters, but they tend to vote in half their numbers on low-turnout elections,\" said pollster Brian Sanderoff, of Research & Polling in Albuquerque. \"They're less likely to vote in nonpresidential election cycles.\"\n\nNew Mexico's Republican Party is calling Johnson a spoiler, saying he will draw votes from their candidate -- construction contractor and political newcomer Mick Rich -- playing directly into Democrats' hands.\n\nJohnson dismisses the GOP as a lost cause this year in New Mexico, which sided with Hillary Clinton in 2016 by a wide margin and twice backed Barack Obama.\n\n\"I do not think that a Republican can win a statewide race in New Mexico. I think that Trump has polluted those chances,\" he said.\n\nAs a Republican governor, Johnson vetoed more than 700 bills in perpetual standoffs with a Legislature run by Democrats, vetoing the entire budget in his final year only to have legislators override him. His advocacy as governor for marijuana legalization, beginning in 1999 when the stance was unpopular, still provides a political calling card -- one that Johnson says speaks to his honesty regardless of political consequences.\n\nCampaign disclosure filings show Johnson also is an investor in the nascent legal marijuana sector and a professional adviser to a cannabis hedge fund. He is a recreational user himself -- in a state that regulates medical marijuana access but still penalizes recreational cannabis.\n\nHeinrich, the Democrat, recently threw his support behind legalizing marijuana, while Johnson already is contemplating how to provide pardons for legions of drug-possession convicts.\n\nFor Johnson, a third act in politics at age 65 would mean setting aside a lifestyle of 100-day winter ski seasons and summer endurance bicycle rallies along the Continental Divide. Barnstorming through tiny towns to shake hands and deliver yard signs, Johnson said Trump has created the perfect storm for a Libertarian or truly independent candidate to join Congress and broker majority votes -- calling Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Angus King of Maine independents in name only.\n\nStopping unannounced at a barbecue stand at midday, Johnson ignites flickers of recognition and then conversations that often turn to his thoughts on cannabis.\n\n\"I love his policies,\" said Jace Alderson, 61, of Moriarty, recalling Johnson's hard-line stance against government spending as a Republican governor. \"It doesn't matter what party he is.\"","source":{"uri":"wral.com","dataType":"news","title":"WRAL.com"},"authors":[],"eventUri":null,"location":{"type":"place","label":{"eng":"Tucumcari, New Mexico"},"lat":35.17191,"long":-103.72686,"country":{"type":"country","label":{"eng":"United States"},"lat":39.76,"long":-98.5}}},{"uri":"965790356","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2018-10-10","time":"05:19:00","dateTime":"2018-10-10T05:19:00Z","dataType":"news","sim":0.6901960968971252,"url":"https://www.eurweb.com/2018/10/antonio-brown-sued-for-throwing-furniture-from-balcony-that-nearly-killed-toddler/","title":"Antonio Brown Sued for Throwing Furniture From Balcony That Nearly Killed Toddler","body":"According to TMZ, Brown snapped back in April and threw a bunch of furniture off the balcony of his 14th story luxury apartment, and some of it shattered near a 22-month-old baby.\n\nA lawsuit obtained by TMZ Sports states Antonio is being sued by Ophir Sternberg -- who claims it was his toddler son who was walking around the pool at the apartment complex with his grandfather when suddenly \"large objects started to fall from the building many floors above them.\"\n\nOTHER NEWS YOU MIGHT HAVE MISSED: Kanye West and Donald Trump Have a Lunch Date at the White House\n\nSternberg claims the items included: 2 very large vases, a heavy ottoman and other pieces of furniture.

Around midday it was expected to become one of the Panhandle's worst hurricanes in memory with 125 mph winds and a life-threatening storm surge of up to 13 feet (4 meters).\n\nFlorida officials said roughly 375,000 people up and down the Gulf Coast had been urged or ordered to evacuate. Evacuations spanned 22 counties from the Florida Panhandle into north central Florida. But fears lingered that some failed to heed the calls to get out of Michael's way as the hard-charging storm began speeding north over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nWorried meteorologists said it had the potential of becoming one of the worst storms in the history of Florida's Panhandle.\n\n\"I guess it's the worst case scenario. I don't think anyone would have experienced this in the Panhandle,\" meteorologist Ryan Maue of weathermodels.com told The Associated Press. \"This is going to have structure damaging winds along the coast and hurricane force winds inland.\"\n\nUniversity of Georgia's Marshall Shepherd, a former president of the American Meteorological Society, called it a \"life-altering event\" on Facebook and said he watched the storm's growth on satellite images with a pit growing in his stomach.\n\nFranklin County Sheriff A.J. Smith near the vulnerable coast said his deputies had gone door to door in some places urging people to evacuate. \"We have done everything we can as far as getting the word out,\" Smith said. \"Hopefully more people will leave.\"\n\nOn the exposed coast of Florida's Big Bend, most of the waterfront homes in Keaton Beach stood vacant amid fears of a life-threatening storm surge in an area that hadn't seen a potentially catastrophic major hurricane in decades. Even so, 77-year-old resident Robert Sadousky wasn't quite ready to evacuate yet.\n\nThe retired mill worker has spent more than half his life on the coast and weathered his share of storms. He chose the spot where his house stands on tall stilts overlooking the Gulf waters in 1972 after it was the only lot left dry after a storm flooded the beach that year.\n\nWhile most homes around him are vacation rentals or summer getaways for their owners, Sadousky had stayed put through more than four decades of storms. No longer. Michael was expected to bring surging seas up 9 feet (2.75 meters) above ground level at Keaton Beach.\n\n\"I know it's going to cover everything around here,\" Sadousky said Tuesday, eyeing water lapping at the edge of a canal behind his home. He pulled two small boat docks from the water, packed his pickup and picked some beans from his garden before getting out -- like hundreds of thousands elsewhere.\n\nAt 11 p.m. Tuesday, the eye of Michael was about 220 miles (355 kilometers) south-southwest of Panama City, Florida. It also was about 200 miles (325 kilometers) south-southwest of Apalachicola, Florida. But forecasters said winds and outer rain bands of a storm that was strengthening and becoming better organized by the hour would begin lashing the coast well ahead of the eye making landfall.\n\nMore than 180,000 people of those leaving were under mandatory evacuation orders, the long lines of cars jamming routes out Tuesday.\n\n\"We don't know if it's going to wipe out our house or not,\" Jason McDonald, of Panama City, said as he and his wife drove north to safety into Alabama with their two children, ages 5 and 7. \"We want to get them out of the way.\"\n\nFlorida Gov. Rick Scott warned it was a \"monstrous hurricane,\" and his Democratic opponent for the Senate, Sen. Bill Nelson, said a \"wall of water\" could cause destruction along the Panhandle.\n\n\"Don't think that you can ride this out if you're in a low-lying area,\" Nelson said on CNN.\n\nBut some officials were worried by what they weren't seeing -- a rush of evacuees.\n\n\"I am not seeing the level of traffic on the roadways that I would expect when we've called for the evacuation of 75 percent of this county,\" Bay County Sheriff Tommy Ford said.\n\nIn the dangerously exposed coastal town of Apalachicola, population 2,500, Sally Crown planned to go home and hunker down with her two dogs.\n\n\"We've been through this before,\" she said. \"This might be really bad and serious. But in my experience, it's always blown way out of proportion.\"\n\nMandatory evacuation orders went into effect in Panama City Beach and other low-lying areas in the storm's path. That included Pensacola Beach but not in Pensacola itself, a city of about 54,000.\n\nMichael could dump up to a foot (30 centimeters) of rain over some Panhandle communities before its remnants go back out to sea by way of the mid-Atlantic states over the next few days. Forecasters said it also could bring 3 to 6 inches of rain to Georgia, the Carolinas and Virginia, triggering flash flooding in a corner of the country still recovering from Florence. And isolated tornadoes were also possible.\n\nLush reported from St. Petersburg, Florida.

Sorbe said the meeting was a valuable opportunity for Senate members to share their ideas with students involved in student government at other schools in the state.\n\n\"I think student federation is a good time for collaboration for student government associations across the state and to shoot ideas off of each other that we may be having and complications we might be having,\" Sorbe said. \"They are good people to bounce ideas off of because they are doing the same things we are doing just in different places.\"\n\nThe Board of Regents meeting covered a variety of topics including need-based financial aid, faculty salary competitiveness, Native American student enrollment and free speech policy revisions.\n\nSorbe said he found the first reading of the free speech policy an interesting point of discussion.\n\n\"They saw their first reading and it was approved to their second one where the Regents will most likely vote on the policy in December,\" Sorbe said. \"Outside of that, we also met South Dakota student federation out at Mines and there we discussed the Board of Regents priorities, which will be introduced in resolution from USD to student federation for all their agendas.\"\n\nSorbe and Green attended the meeting on behalf of USD, while the rest of the senators went on a volunteer basis. The Board of Regents meets every two months.\n\nSkunk said attending this meeting gave him an appreciation for USD's SGA.\n\n\"We should take pride in what we have as far as student government goes,\" Skunk said. \"If you look at the student federations at the School of Mines, their office is one room. We are very lucky here.\"\n\nAt this week's SGA meeting, the Senate relooked at five bills and one resolution. Three of the five bills were passed at this meeting. Senate Bill 78, which appropriates the budget for the Seldinger Society, Senate Bill 79, which approves the budget for the Philosophy club and Senate Bill 80 which appropriates the Math Club budget.\n\nThe other two bills, Senate Bill 76, which poses to change the SGA election dates and Senate Bill 77, which is on student organization recognition, will be brought back after going to internal reviews for the next meeting.\n\nSenate Resolution 6, which poses to change the MUC hours back to 2 a.m., was discussed and voted on, but it did not pass. Besides the discussion for this resolution, special guest Dan Dailey, Dean of Libraries, also addressed the Muenster University Center hours.\n\nDailey distributed a document of facts for the Senate to look at while he spoke. According to the document, I.D. Weeks Library originally began staying open till 2 a.m. in 2010. The dean of libraries and staff reviewed the policy again in 2014 and saw that there was the low utilization of the library, but decided to keep the policy as is.\n\nBefore the hour's change was made this school year, there was a thorough review of the current hours. Data was collected on the number of student present after midnight along with the use of computers after midnight.\n\n\"A very small fraction of those entries into I.D. Weeks happen after midnight during the weeknights,\" Daily said. \"I asked our staff to look at the utilization of I.D. Weeks after midnight, we dug into the statistics in 2017 and 2018.

Well, he's in that space again because the man who says he was assaulted by Williams last Friday in Portland is suing the funnyman for $76,000.\n\nHis lawyer says the money is for his physical injuries and emotional distress. The alleged victim's name is Wali Kanani and he's the owner of Delta Town Car Service in Portland.\n\nKanani was picking up Williams, his German Shepherd, and his colleagues at a private hanger of the airport, reports Fox12.\n\nThe complaint, filed Monday, states Williams insisted his dog sit in the front seat, and Kanani said no.\n\nThe document outlines what happened from there. It alleges Williams called Kanani names like \"white trash,\" then punched him in the face.\n\nKanani ran inside to get away and Williams reportedly \"commanded his dog to start chasing\" him, according to court documents.\n\n\"This is totally inappropriate behavior and there has to be some sort of deterrent effect above and beyond what the lawsuit itself would bring,\" Kanani's attorney Adam Heder said.\n\nThat's why Heder filed the complaint now asking for $76,000 plus medical costs.\n\nREAD THIS/BLIND ITEM: HIS 'GIRLFRIEND' IS PRETTY MUCH AN AFTERTHOUGHT\n\nThe article goes on to say that Attorney Heder wouldn't provide photos of Kanani's injuries, but said he had cuts and swelling on his face, a broken tooth and tinnitus in one ear, as well as what he's suffered emotionally.\n\n\"You can imagine in the course of doing your job getting struck in the face in this aggressive and belligerent manner can cause a tremendous amount of emotional distress to even the best of us,\" Heder said.\n\nAs far as what's happening with Williams in court, on Monday he had a hearing on the charge of assault in the fourth degree. The judge apparently wasn't impressed and he was released on that charge. However, the judge ordered him to stay away from Kanani (but now Kanani is suing him).\n\nSo, even though Williams doesn't have to worry about that charge, as we've reported, he's is still in lockdown in Portland because he's wanted in Georgia","source":{"uri":"eurweb.com","dataType":"news","title":"EURweb"},"authors":[],"eventUri":null,"location":null},{"uri":"965790367","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2018-10-10","time":"05:19:00","dateTime":"2018-10-10T05:19:00Z","dataType":"news","sim":0.6313725709915161,"url":"https://www.mediaite.com/tv/don-lemon-people-harassing-ted-cruz-at-restaurant-wasnt-mob-behavior-its-people-who-are-upset/","title":"Don Lemon: People Harassing Ted Cruz at Restaurant Wasn't 'Mob Behavior,' It's 'People Who Are Upset'","body":"CNN host Don Lemon took a similar stance with his colleague Brooke Baldwin about what defines a mob.\n\nEarlier in the day, Daily Beast columnist Matt Lewis argued that the anti-Kavanaugh protestors who harassed Sen.

Dall'Imis al fondo perequativo, dai nidi al trasporto pubblico, in assenza di informazioni abbiamo dovuto confermare i numeri dell'anno scorso\".\n\nLa proposta di bilancio completa sarà depositata il 15 novembre, un mese prima della discussione in aula.\n\nCome avviene ormai da svariati anni, tutti i Servizi comunali sono stati invitati a ridurre la spesa corrente e a calibrare bene le previsioni, in modo da non generare avanzo. Per quanto riguarda i contenuti della manovra, il sindaco ha sottolineato l'invarianza delle tariffe (\"al massimo ci sarà un adeguamento al tasso di inflazione programmata\"), l'aumento delle risorse per i lavori socialmente utili e per il turismo: \"E' un settore che tira - ha spiegato Andreatta - Quest'anno poi è andato particolarmente bene grazie alla concentrazione di grandi eventi ospitati in città\".\n\nMassima attenzione anche al sociale, con l'aumento (costante in questi anni) delle voci per l'integrazione dell'affitto e per supportare le famiglie più fragili. Naturalmente in primo piano resta anche il capitolo sicurezza, che prevede tra l'altro la sostituzione di tutti gli agenti che andranno in pensione e il rafforzamento della squadra aggiuntiva della polizia municipale, che diventa stabile e non più a termine come ai suoi esordi.\n\nTra i temi del confronto, pure il bando Periferie e il nodo dei 18 milioni di euro prima confermati e poi messi in dubbio dal governo nazionale: \"Pare che i fondi non ci siano stati tolti, ma siano stati posticipati al 2020 - ha spiegato l'assessore Gilmozzi - Se le risorse non arrivassero, ai Comuni è stata data la possibilità di utilizzare l'avanzo di bilancio. Non che la cosa ci faccia piacere, perché l'avanzo sono soldi nostri, non dello Stato\".\n\nL'assessore Gilmozzi si è soffermato anche sugli investimenti dei prossimi anni: dal restyling di piazza della Mostra alla nuova piscina, dal recupero dell'ex Atesina a quello dell'ex facoltà di Lettere, dal nuovo quartiere in viale dei Tigli ai numerosi interventi di manutenzione sul patrimonio edilizio esistente.\n\nI sindacati hanno invitato l'Amministrazione comunale a mantenere alta l'attenzione sulla sicurezza e sulla percezione della sicurezza da parte dei cittadini (Pomini) e sulle politiche di conciliazione per favorire il lavoro delle donne (Grosselli). Alotti ha sollecitato il sindaco ad aumentare la tassazione sulle case sfitte. E ancora Grosselli ha chiesto di mirare non solo alla riduzione dei costi ma anche alla tutela del lavoro negli appalti di servizi.","source":{"uri":"lavocedeltrentino.it","dataType":"news","title":"La Voce del Trentino Quotidiano online INDIPENDENTE"},"authors":[],"eventUri":null,"location":null},{"uri":"965790374","lang":"ita","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2018-10-10","time":"05:19:00","dateTime":"2018-10-10T05:19:00Z","dataType":"news","sim":0,"url":"https://www.lavocedeltrentino.it/2018/10/10/concluso-nel-migliore-dei-modi-lo-street-food-festival-levento-che-unisce-la-comunita-e-colora-le-strade/","title":"Concluso nel migliore dei modi lo Street Food Festival, l'evento che unisce la comunità e colora le strade - La voce del Trentino","body":"Si è conclusa domenica la terza edizione dello Street Food Festival, l'evento ha colorato le strade della città che, come sempre, sono state riempite dai profumi più disparati ed intriganti.\n\nSolo qualche giorno fa è stato celebrato un altro importante appuntamento, il Mercato Europeo. Anche qui, il cibo è stato l'assoluto protagonista dell'iniziativa che ha contato un significativo numero di visitatori.\n\nSapori italiani, sapori internazionali ed esotici hanno quindi conquistato la cittadinanza in un susseguirsi di appuntamenti \"appetitosi\".\n\nI truck che sono accorsi allo Street Food Festival, occupando il centro storico di Rovereto, si sono dimostrati dei veri e propri \"intrattenitori\", esponevano, oltre alle ricercate pietanze, la cultura del luogo che rappresentavano e questo, non può che considerarsi un valore aggiunto per una città che sta diventando sempre più all'avanguardia e internazionale.\n\nLa nascita dello street food (cibo da strada) risale a tempi antichissimi e, ancora oggi, è considerata una pratica di socializzazione, un momento di svago che ricorda il passato e la bellezza dello \"stare in paese\".\n\nAd aderire a questa edizione più di 20 furgoncini d'annata restaurati e colorati. Hanno partecipato Toscana, Veneto, Lazio, Calabria, Marche, Lombardia e molte altre regioni, ma, anche questa volta, i sapori esteri non potevano mancare; intramontabili i truck messicani, spagnoli e venezuelani.\n\nL' evento non si è però scemato dopo l'ora di cena. Durante queste giornate di festa, alcuni momenti sono stati vivacizzati da animazione con musica, attività, giochi per bambini, spettacoli di danza ed esibizioni con i tessuti aerei.\n\n\"Veniamo spesso con gli amici al food festival-spiegano degli studenti roveretani-, è una sorta di appuntamento fisso.

The rest is not yet history as Gary Johnson, a former governor of New Mexico, seeks a seat in the U.S. Senate as a Libertarian and political wild card.\n\nJohnson says his high-desert home state of 2 million residents stands to gain considerable influence in the Senate if he is elected as a freewheeling swing vote -- possibly a decisive vote in the chamber, as Republicans defend a slim 51-49 majority in November elections.\n\nDemocrats are being forced to defend what had seemed like a secure seat for incumbent first-term Sen. Martin Heinrich, fending off Johnson's allure among voters as an uncompromising fiscal conservative with a quirky brand of free-market, pro-cannabis policies.\n\n\"Arguably if elected I would be the swing vote in the U.S. Senate, and that would be a big yank for New Mexico. It should benefit New Mexico in a really big way,\" Johnson tells a crowd of two dozen at a candidate forum in Tucumcari, near a string of abandoned highway-side motels, on the state's rural eastern plains.\n\nNationwide, Democrats are defending 26 incumbent Senate seats, while Republicans are defending only nine. The stakes in fall Senate races have been on dramatic display in Supreme Court confirmation proceedings amid accusations of sexual misconduct against nominee Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nJohnson says he would be a voice of common sense in the Senate and a rare nonpartisan vote during Supreme Court confirmation proceedings -- and an impartial judge in the event of a Senate impeachment trial against President Donald Trump, though he sees no impeachable offense so far.\n\nUntil then, Johnson applauds Trump's work at diminishing regulations, and denounces White House immigration policies as shameful and bad for the economy.\n\nThe real political crisis and looming threat to America's wellbeing, Johnson says, is runaway deficit spending. And the day of reckoning will come, according to Johnson, in the form of Venezuela-style inflation if the U.S. continues to spend beyond its means, on military and social programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.\n\n\"I applaud Trump on the tax cuts, but where is the spending reduction to go along with that,\" said Johnson, who wants to join the Senate Budget Committee that sets out Congress' broad blueprint for levels of federal revenues and spending.\n\nProminent Democrats say Johnson can't barge his way onto the committee, and they suspect he would readily collaborate to torpedo federal health care and nutritional subsidies that New Mexico relies on heavily.\n\nDede Feldman, a Democratic political strategist who served in the state Senate when Johnson was governor, questions Johnson's credentials as a voice of moderation, noting he was held in contempt as governor by the New Mexico Supreme Court for persisting with aggressive welfare changes without legislative approval.\n\nAt a community bank in Tucumcari, Johnson finds a receptive audience for his criticism of burdensome federal financial regulation in a meeting with the board of directors -- and some astonishment at his calls to decrease military spending by 23 percent, cut Medicare and retool Social Security.\n\n\"I'm 80 years old. I'm on Medicare, I receive Social Security, and I'm retired from the military,\" said Bill Curry, a board member at the Tucumcari Federal Savings and Loan Association, which was founded during the 1930s Great Depression. \"You've hit me on four different things.\"\n\nJohnson doesn't back down, cautioning social and retirement programs won't be around for future generations without prompt action.\n\nHe derides as a budget-buster his opponent Heinrich's support of \"Medicare-for-all\" legislation aimed at making strides toward universal health insurance coverage.\n\nHeinrich has cast himself as a defender of federal health and retirement benefits, and proponent of the new outdoor-recreation and renewable-energy economies -- a progressive hedge in an oil-based state economy.\n\nHeinrich, with youthful looks at age 46, has turned his committee appointments, including Armed Services, into a venue for expedient constituent politics in support of the New Mexico's military facilities and veterans.\n\nJohnson's answer to escalating medical costs is less regulation and even easing licensing requirement for medical professionals. His faith in free-market solutions with less regulation spills over into everything from oilfield methane emissions to public education, where Johnson supports government spending on independent schools through vouchers.\n\nPollsters and analysts see obstacles to Johnson building a quick coalition, after his late entry to the race in August.\n\n\"There are a lot of unaffiliated registered voters, but they tend to vote in half their numbers on low-turnout elections,\" said pollster Brian Sanderoff, of Research & Polling in Albuquerque. \"They're less likely to vote in nonpresidential election cycles.\"\n\nNew Mexico's Republican Party is calling Johnson a spoiler, saying he will draw votes from their candidate -- construction contractor and political newcomer Mick Rich -- playing directly into Democrats' hands.\n\nJohnson dismisses the GOP as a lost cause this year in New Mexico, which sided with Hillary Clinton in 2016 by a wide margin and twice backed Barack Obama.\n\n\"I do not think that a Republican can win a statewide race in New Mexico. I think that Trump has polluted those chances,\" he said.\n\nAs a Republican governor, Johnson vetoed more than 700 bills in perpetual standoffs with a Legislature run by Democrats, vetoing the entire budget in his final year only to have legislators override him. His advocacy as governor for marijuana legalization, beginning in 1999 when the stance was unpopular, still provides a political calling card -- one that Johnson says speaks to his honesty regardless of political consequences.\n\nCampaign disclosure filings show Johnson also is an investor in the nascent legal marijuana sector and a professional adviser to a cannabis hedge fund. He is a recreational user himself -- in a state that regulates medical marijuana access but still penalizes recreational cannabis.\n\nHeinrich, the Democrat, recently threw his support behind legalizing marijuana, while Johnson already is contemplating how to provide pardons for legions of drug-possession convicts.\n\nFor Johnson, a third act in politics at age 65 would mean setting aside a lifestyle of 100-day winter ski seasons and summer endurance bicycle rallies along the Continental Divide. Barnstorming through tiny towns to shake hands and deliver yard signs, Johnson said Trump has created the perfect storm for a Libertarian or truly independent candidate to join Congress and broker majority votes -- calling Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Angus King of Maine independents in name only.\n\nStopping unannounced at a barbecue stand at midday, Johnson ignites flickers of recognition and then conversations that often turn to his thoughts on cannabis.\n\n\"I love his policies,\" said Jace Alderson, 61, of Moriarty, recalling Johnson's hard-line stance against government spending as a Republican governor. \"It doesn't matter what party he is.\"","source":{"uri":"wral.com","dataType":"news","title":"WRAL.com"},"authors":[],"eventUri":null,"location":{"type":"place","label":{"eng":"Tucumcari, New Mexico"},"lat":35.17191,"long":-103.72686,"country":{"type":"country","label":{"eng":"United States"},"lat":39.76,"long":-98.5}}},{"uri":"965790356","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2018-10-10","time":"05:19:00","dateTime":"2018-10-10T05:19:00Z","dataType":"news","sim":0.6901960968971252,"url":"https://www.eurweb.com/2018/10/antonio-brown-sued-for-throwing-furniture-from-balcony-that-nearly-killed-toddler/","title":"Antonio Brown Sued for Throwing Furniture From Balcony That Nearly Killed Toddler","body":"According to TMZ, Brown snapped back in April and threw a bunch of furniture off the balcony of his 14th story luxury apartment, and some of it shattered near a 22-month-old baby.\n\nA lawsuit obtained by TMZ Sports states Antonio is being sued by Ophir Sternberg -- who claims it was his toddler son who was walking around the pool at the apartment complex with his grandfather when suddenly \"large objects started to fall from the building many floors above them.\"\n\nOTHER NEWS YOU MIGHT HAVE MISSED: Kanye West and Donald Trump Have a Lunch Date at the White House\n\nSternberg claims the items included: 2 very large vases, a heavy ottoman and other pieces of furniture.

Around midday it was expected to become one of the Panhandle's worst hurricanes in memory with 125 mph winds and a life-threatening storm surge of up to 13 feet (4 meters).\n\nFlorida officials said roughly 375,000 people up and down the Gulf Coast had been urged or ordered to evacuate. Evacuations spanned 22 counties from the Florida Panhandle into north central Florida. But fears lingered that some failed to heed the calls to get out of Michael's way as the hard-charging storm began speeding north over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nWorried meteorologists said it had the potential of becoming one of the worst storms in the history of Florida's Panhandle.\n\n\"I guess it's the worst case scenario. I don't think anyone would have experienced this in the Panhandle,\" meteorologist Ryan Maue of weathermodels.com told The Associated Press. \"This is going to have structure damaging winds along the coast and hurricane force winds inland.\"\n\nUniversity of Georgia's Marshall Shepherd, a former president of the American Meteorological Society, called it a \"life-altering event\" on Facebook and said he watched the storm's growth on satellite images with a pit growing in his stomach.\n\nFranklin County Sheriff A.J. Smith near the vulnerable coast said his deputies had gone door to door in some places urging people to evacuate. \"We have done everything we can as far as getting the word out,\" Smith said. \"Hopefully more people will leave.\"\n\nOn the exposed coast of Florida's Big Bend, most of the waterfront homes in Keaton Beach stood vacant amid fears of a life-threatening storm surge in an area that hadn't seen a potentially catastrophic major hurricane in decades. Even so, 77-year-old resident Robert Sadousky wasn't quite ready to evacuate yet.\n\nThe retired mill worker has spent more than half his life on the coast and weathered his share of storms. He chose the spot where his house stands on tall stilts overlooking the Gulf waters in 1972 after it was the only lot left dry after a storm flooded the beach that year.\n\nWhile most homes around him are vacation rentals or summer getaways for their owners, Sadousky had stayed put through more than four decades of storms. No longer. Michael was expected to bring surging seas up 9 feet (2.75 meters) above ground level at Keaton Beach.\n\n\"I know it's going to cover everything around here,\" Sadousky said Tuesday, eyeing water lapping at the edge of a canal behind his home. He pulled two small boat docks from the water, packed his pickup and picked some beans from his garden before getting out -- like hundreds of thousands elsewhere.\n\nAt 11 p.m. Tuesday, the eye of Michael was about 220 miles (355 kilometers) south-southwest of Panama City, Florida. It also was about 200 miles (325 kilometers) south-southwest of Apalachicola, Florida. But forecasters said winds and outer rain bands of a storm that was strengthening and becoming better organized by the hour would begin lashing the coast well ahead of the eye making landfall.\n\nMore than 180,000 people of those leaving were under mandatory evacuation orders, the long lines of cars jamming routes out Tuesday.\n\n\"We don't know if it's going to wipe out our house or not,\" Jason McDonald, of Panama City, said as he and his wife drove north to safety into Alabama with their two children, ages 5 and 7. \"We want to get them out of the way.\"\n\nFlorida Gov. Rick Scott warned it was a \"monstrous hurricane,\" and his Democratic opponent for the Senate, Sen. Bill Nelson, said a \"wall of water\" could cause destruction along the Panhandle.\n\n\"Don't think that you can ride this out if you're in a low-lying area,\" Nelson said on CNN.\n\nBut some officials were worried by what they weren't seeing -- a rush of evacuees.\n\n\"I am not seeing the level of traffic on the roadways that I would expect when we've called for the evacuation of 75 percent of this county,\" Bay County Sheriff Tommy Ford said.\n\nIn the dangerously exposed coastal town of Apalachicola, population 2,500, Sally Crown planned to go home and hunker down with her two dogs.\n\n\"We've been through this before,\" she said. \"This might be really bad and serious. But in my experience, it's always blown way out of proportion.\"\n\nMandatory evacuation orders went into effect in Panama City Beach and other low-lying areas in the storm's path. That included Pensacola Beach but not in Pensacola itself, a city of about 54,000.\n\nMichael could dump up to a foot (30 centimeters) of rain over some Panhandle communities before its remnants go back out to sea by way of the mid-Atlantic states over the next few days. Forecasters said it also could bring 3 to 6 inches of rain to Georgia, the Carolinas and Virginia, triggering flash flooding in a corner of the country still recovering from Florence. And isolated tornadoes were also possible.\n\nLush reported from St. Petersburg, Florida. Associated Press writers Russ Bynum in Keaton Beach, Florida, Jay Reeves in Panama City Beach, Florida, Jonathan Drew in Raleigh, North Carolina and Science Writer Seth Borenstein in Kensington, Maryland, contributed to this report.","source":{"uri":"wral.com","dataType":"news","title":"WRAL.com"},"authors":[],"eventUri":null,"location":null},{"uri":"965789282","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2018-10-10","time":"05:17:00","dateTime":"2018-10-10T05:17:00Z","dataType":"news","sim":0,"url":"http://volanteonline.com/2018/10/sga-senators-reflect-on-board-of-regents-meeting-last-tuesday/","title":"SGA senators reflect on Board of Regents meeting last Tuesday","body":"USD's Student Government Association resumed their weekly meetings after canceling last Tuesday's meeting in order to attend the Board of Regents meeting in Rapid City.\n\nSGA sent five members to the meeting, including SGA president Josh Sorbe, vice president Madison Green, office manager Amber Hulse, senator Matt Yetter and senator Christian Skunk.\n\nThe meeting was held in Rapid City at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology. Sorbe said the meeting was a valuable opportunity for Senate members to share their ideas with students involved in student government at other schools in the state.\n\n\"I think student federation is a good time for collaboration for student government associations across the state and to shoot ideas off of each other that we may be having and complications we might be having,\" Sorbe said. \"They are good people to bounce ideas off of because they are doing the same things we are doing just in different places.\"\n\nThe Board of Regents meeting covered a variety of topics including need-based financial aid, faculty salary competitiveness, Native American student enrollment and free speech policy revisions.\n\nSorbe said he found the first reading of the free speech policy an interesting point of discussion.\n\n\"They saw their first reading and it was approved to their second one where the Regents will most likely vote on the policy in December,\" Sorbe said. \"Outside of that, we also met South Dakota student federation out at Mines and there we discussed the Board of Regents priorities, which will be introduced in resolution from USD to student federation for all their agendas.\"\n\nSorbe and Green attended the meeting on behalf of USD, while the rest of the senators went on a volunteer basis. The Board of Regents meets every two months.\n\nSkunk said attending this meeting gave him an appreciation for USD's SGA.\n\n\"We should take pride in what we have as far as student government goes,\" Skunk said. \"If you look at the student federations at the School of Mines, their office is one room. We are very lucky here.\"\n\nAt this week's SGA meeting, the Senate relooked at five bills and one resolution. Three of the five bills were passed at this meeting. Senate Bill 78, which appropriates the budget for the Seldinger Society, Senate Bill 79, which approves the budget for the Philosophy club and Senate Bill 80 which appropriates the Math Club budget.\n\nThe other two bills, Senate Bill 76, which poses to change the SGA election dates and Senate Bill 77, which is on student organization recognition, will be brought back after going to internal reviews for the next meeting.\n\nSenate Resolution 6, which poses to change the MUC hours back to 2 a.m., was discussed and voted on, but it did not pass. Besides the discussion for this resolution, special guest Dan Dailey, Dean of Libraries, also addressed the Muenster University Center hours.\n\nDailey distributed a document of facts for the Senate to look at while he spoke. According to the document, I.D. Weeks Library originally began staying open till 2 a.m. in 2010. The dean of libraries and staff reviewed the policy again in 2014 and saw that there was the low utilization of the library, but decided to keep the policy as is.\n\nBefore the hour's change was made this school year, there was a thorough review of the current hours. Data was collected on the number of student present after midnight along with the use of computers after midnight.\n\n\"A very small fraction of those entries into I.D.

Well, he's in that space again because the man who says he was assaulted by Williams last Friday in Portland is suing the funnyman for $76,000.\n\nHis lawyer says the money is for his physical injuries and emotional distress. The alleged victim's name is Wali Kanani and he's the owner of Delta Town Car Service in Portland.\n\nKanani was picking up Williams, his German Shepherd, and his colleagues at a private hanger of the airport, reports Fox12.\n\nThe complaint, filed Monday, states Williams insisted his dog sit in the front seat, and Kanani said no.\n\nThe document outlines what happened from there.

The judge apparently wasn't impressed and he was released on that charge. However, the judge ordered him to stay away from Kanani (but now Kanani is suing him).\n\nSo, even though Williams doesn't have to worry about that charge, as we've reported, he's is still in lockdown in Portland because he's wanted in Georgia","source":{"uri":"eurweb.com","dataType":"news","title":"EURweb"},"authors":[],"eventUri":null,"location":null},{"uri":"965790367","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2018-10-10","time":"05:19:00","dateTime":"2018-10-10T05:19:00Z","dataType":"news","sim":0.6313725709915161,"url":"https://www.mediaite.com/tv/don-lemon-people-harassing-ted-cruz-at-restaurant-wasnt-mob-behavior-its-people-who-are-upset/","title":"Don Lemon: People Harassing Ted Cruz at Restaurant Wasn't 'Mob Behavior,' It's 'People Who Are Upset'","body":"CNN host Don Lemon took a similar stance with his colleague Brooke Baldwin about what defines a mob.\n\nEarlier in the day, Daily Beast columnist Matt Lewis argued that the anti-Kavanaugh protestors who harassed Sen.

Dall'Imis al fondo perequativo, dai nidi al trasporto pubblico, in assenza di informazioni abbiamo dovuto confermare i numeri dell'anno scorso\".\n\nLa proposta di bilancio completa sarà depositata il 15 novembre, un mese prima della discussione in aula.\n\nCome avviene ormai da svariati anni, tutti i Servizi comunali sono stati invitati a ridurre la spesa corrente e a calibrare bene le previsioni, in modo da non generare avanzo. Per quanto riguarda i contenuti della manovra, il sindaco ha sottolineato l'invarianza delle tariffe (\"al massimo ci sarà un adeguamento al tasso di inflazione programmata\"), l'aumento delle risorse per i lavori socialmente utili e per il turismo: \"E' un settore che tira - ha spiegato Andreatta - Quest'anno poi è andato particolarmente bene grazie alla concentrazione di grandi eventi ospitati in città\".\n\nMassima attenzione anche al sociale, con l'aumento (costante in questi anni) delle voci per l'integrazione dell'affitto e per supportare le famiglie più fragili. Naturalmente in primo piano resta anche il capitolo sicurezza, che prevede tra l'altro la sostituzione di tutti gli agenti che andranno in pensione e il rafforzamento della squadra aggiuntiva della polizia municipale, che diventa stabile e non più a termine come ai suoi esordi.\n\nTra i temi del confronto, pure il bando Periferie e il nodo dei 18 milioni di euro prima confermati e poi messi in dubbio dal governo nazionale: \"Pare che i fondi non ci siano stati tolti, ma siano stati posticipati al 2020 - ha spiegato l'assessore Gilmozzi - Se le risorse non arrivassero, ai Comuni è stata data la possibilità di utilizzare l'avanzo di bilancio. Non che la cosa ci faccia piacere, perché l'avanzo sono soldi nostri, non dello Stato\".\n\nL'assessore Gilmozzi si è soffermato anche sugli investimenti dei prossimi anni: dal restyling di piazza della Mostra alla nuova piscina, dal recupero dell'ex Atesina a quello dell'ex facoltà di Lettere, dal nuovo quartiere in viale dei Tigli ai numerosi interventi di manutenzione sul patrimonio edilizio esistente.\n\nI sindacati hanno invitato l'Amministrazione comunale a mantenere alta l'attenzione sulla sicurezza e sulla percezione della sicurezza da parte dei cittadini (Pomini) e sulle politiche di conciliazione per favorire il lavoro delle donne (Grosselli). Alotti ha sollecitato il sindaco ad aumentare la tassazione sulle case sfitte. E ancora Grosselli ha chiesto di mirare non solo alla riduzione dei costi ma anche alla tutela del lavoro negli appalti di servizi.","source":{"uri":"lavocedeltrentino.it","dataType":"news","title":"La Voce del Trentino Quotidiano online INDIPENDENTE"},"authors":[],"eventUri":null,"location":null},{"uri":"965790374","lang":"ita","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2018-10-10","time":"05:19:00","dateTime":"2018-10-10T05:19:00Z","dataType":"news","sim":0,"url":"https://www.lavocedeltrentino.it/2018/10/10/concluso-nel-migliore-dei-modi-lo-street-food-festival-levento-che-unisce-la-comunita-e-colora-le-strade/","title":"Concluso nel migliore dei modi lo Street Food Festival, l'evento che unisce la comunità e colora le strade - La voce del Trentino","body":"Si è conclusa domenica la terza edizione dello Street Food Festival, l'evento ha colorato le strade della città che, come sempre, sono state riempite dai profumi più disparati ed intriganti.\n\nSolo qualche giorno fa è stato celebrato un altro importante appuntamento, il Mercato Europeo. Anche qui, il cibo è stato l'assoluto protagonista dell'iniziativa che ha contato un significativo numero di visitatori.\n\nSapori italiani, sapori internazionali ed esotici hanno quindi conquistato la cittadinanza in un susseguirsi di appuntamenti \"appetitosi\".\n\nI truck che sono accorsi allo Street Food Festival, occupando il centro storico di Rovereto, si sono dimostrati dei veri e propri \"intrattenitori\", esponevano, oltre alle ricercate pietanze, la cultura del luogo che rappresentavano e questo, non può che considerarsi un valore aggiunto per una città che sta diventando sempre più all'avanguardia e internazionale.\n\nLa nascita dello street food (cibo da strada) risale a tempi antichissimi e, ancora oggi, è considerata una pratica di socializzazione, un momento di svago che ricorda il passato e la bellezza dello \"stare in paese\".\n\nAd aderire a questa edizione più di 20 furgoncini d'annata restaurati e colorati. Hanno partecipato Toscana, Veneto, Lazio, Calabria, Marche, Lombardia e molte altre regioni, ma, anche questa volta, i sapori esteri non potevano mancare; intramontabili i truck messicani, spagnoli e venezuelani.\n\nL' evento non si è però scemato dopo l'ora di cena.

The rest is not yet history as Gary Johnson, a former governor of New Mexico, seeks a seat in the U.S. Senate as a Libertarian and political wild card.\n\nJohnson says his high-desert home state of 2 million residents stands to gain considerable influence in the Senate if he is elected as a freewheeling swing vote -- possibly a decisive vote in the chamber, as Republicans defend a slim 51-49 majority in November elections.\n\nDemocrats are being forced to defend what had seemed like a secure seat for incumbent first-term Sen. Martin Heinrich, fending off Johnson's allure among voters as an uncompromising fiscal conservative with a quirky brand of free-market, pro-cannabis policies.\n\n\"Arguably if elected I would be the swing vote in the U.S. Senate, and that would be a big yank for New Mexico. It should benefit New Mexico in a really big way,\" Johnson tells a crowd of two dozen at a candidate forum in Tucumcari, near a string of abandoned highway-side motels, on the state's rural eastern plains.\n\nNationwide, Democrats are defending 26 incumbent Senate seats, while Republicans are defending only nine. The stakes in fall Senate races have been on dramatic display in Supreme Court confirmation proceedings amid accusations of sexual misconduct against nominee Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nJohnson says he would be a voice of common sense in the Senate and a rare nonpartisan vote during Supreme Court confirmation proceedings -- and an impartial judge in the event of a Senate impeachment trial against President Donald Trump, though he sees no impeachable offense so far.\n\nUntil then, Johnson applauds Trump's work at diminishing regulations, and denounces White House immigration policies as shameful and bad for the economy.\n\nThe real political crisis and looming threat to America's wellbeing, Johnson says, is runaway deficit spending. And the day of reckoning will come, according to Johnson, in the form of Venezuela-style inflation if the U.S. continues to spend beyond its means, on military and social programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.\n\n\"I applaud Trump on the tax cuts, but where is the spending reduction to go along with that,\" said Johnson, who wants to join the Senate Budget Committee that sets out Congress' broad blueprint for levels of federal revenues and spending.\n\nProminent Democrats say Johnson can't barge his way onto the committee, and they suspect he would readily collaborate to torpedo federal health care and nutritional subsidies that New Mexico relies on heavily.\n\nDede Feldman, a Democratic political strategist who served in the state Senate when Johnson was governor, questions Johnson's credentials as a voice of moderation, noting he was held in contempt as governor by the New Mexico Supreme Court for persisting with aggressive welfare changes without legislative approval.\n\nAt a community bank in Tucumcari, Johnson finds a receptive audience for his criticism of burdensome federal financial regulation in a meeting with the board of directors -- and some astonishment at his calls to decrease military spending by 23 percent, cut Medicare and retool Social Security.\n\n\"I'm 80 years old. I'm on Medicare, I receive Social Security, and I'm retired from the military,\" said Bill Curry, a board member at the Tucumcari Federal Savings and Loan Association, which was founded during the 1930s Great Depression. \"You've hit me on four different things.\"\n\nJohnson doesn't back down, cautioning social and retirement programs won't be around for future generations without prompt action.\n\nHe derides as a budget-buster his opponent Heinrich's support of \"Medicare-for-all\" legislation aimed at making strides toward universal health insurance coverage.\n\nHeinrich has cast himself as a defender of federal health and retirement benefits, and proponent of the new outdoor-recreation and renewable-energy economies -- a progressive hedge in an oil-based state economy.\n\nHeinrich, with youthful looks at age 46, has turned his committee appointments, including Armed Services, into a venue for expedient constituent politics in support of the New Mexico's military facilities and veterans.\n\nJohnson's answer to escalating medical costs is less regulation and even easing licensing requirement for medical professionals. His faith in free-market solutions with less regulation spills over into everything from oilfield methane emissions to public education, where Johnson supports government spending on independent schools through vouchers.\n\nPollsters and analysts see obstacles to Johnson building a quick coalition, after his late entry to the race in August.\n\n\"There are a lot of unaffiliated registered voters, but they tend to vote in half their numbers on low-turnout elections,\" said pollster Brian Sanderoff, of Research & Polling in Albuquerque. \"They're less likely to vote in nonpresidential election cycles.\"\n\nNew Mexico's Republican Party is calling Johnson a spoiler, saying he will draw votes from their candidate -- construction contractor and political newcomer Mick Rich -- playing directly into Democrats' hands.\n\nJohnson dismisses the GOP as a lost cause this year in New Mexico, which sided with Hillary Clinton in 2016 by a wide margin and twice backed Barack Obama.\n\n\"I do not think that a Republican can win a statewide race in New Mexico. I think that Trump has polluted those chances,\" he said.\n\nAs a Republican governor, Johnson vetoed more than 700 bills in perpetual standoffs with a Legislature run by Democrats, vetoing the entire budget in his final year only to have legislators override him. His advocacy as governor for marijuana legalization, beginning in 1999 when the stance was unpopular, still provides a political calling card -- one that Johnson says speaks to his honesty regardless of political consequences.\n\nCampaign disclosure filings show Johnson also is an investor in the nascent legal marijuana sector and a professional adviser to a cannabis hedge fund. He is a recreational user himself -- in a state that regulates medical marijuana access but still penalizes recreational cannabis.\n\nHeinrich, the Democrat, recently threw his support behind legalizing marijuana, while Johnson already is contemplating how to provide pardons for legions of drug-possession convicts.\n\nFor Johnson, a third act in politics at age 65 would mean setting aside a lifestyle of 100-day winter ski seasons and summer endurance bicycle rallies along the Continental Divide. Barnstorming through tiny towns to shake hands and deliver yard signs, Johnson said Trump has created the perfect storm for a Libertarian or truly independent candidate to join Congress and broker majority votes -- calling Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Angus King of Maine independents in name only.\n\nStopping unannounced at a barbecue stand at midday, Johnson ignites flickers of recognition and then conversations that often turn to his thoughts on cannabis.\n\n\"I love his policies,\" said Jace Alderson, 61, of Moriarty, recalling Johnson's hard-line stance against government spending as a Republican governor. \"It doesn't matter what party he is.\"","source":{"uri":"wral.com","dataType":"news","title":"WRAL.com"},"authors":[],"eventUri":null,"location":{"type":"place","label":{"eng":"Tucumcari, New Mexico"},"lat":35.17191,"long":-103.72686,"country":{"type":"country","label":{"eng":"United States"},"lat":39.76,"long":-98.5}}},{"uri":"965790356","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2018-10-10","time":"05:19:00","dateTime":"2018-10-10T05:19:00Z","dataType":"news","sim":0.6901960968971252,"url":"https://www.eurweb.com/2018/10/antonio-brown-sued-for-throwing-furniture-from-balcony-that-nearly-killed-toddler/","title":"Antonio Brown Sued for Throwing Furniture From Balcony That Nearly Killed Toddler","body":"According to TMZ, Brown snapped back in April and threw a bunch of furniture off the balcony of his 14th story luxury apartment, and some of it shattered near a 22-month-old baby.\n\nA lawsuit obtained by TMZ Sports states Antonio is being sued by Ophir Sternberg -- who claims it was his toddler son who was walking around the pool at the apartment complex with his grandfather when suddenly \"large objects started to fall from the building many floors above them.\"\n\nOTHER NEWS YOU MIGHT HAVE MISSED: Kanye West and Donald Trump Have a Lunch Date at the White House\n\nSternberg claims the items included: 2 very large vases, a heavy ottoman and other pieces of furniture.

Around midday it was expected to become one of the Panhandle's worst hurricanes in memory with 125 mph winds and a life-threatening storm surge of up to 13 feet (4 meters).\n\nFlorida officials said roughly 375,000 people up and down the Gulf Coast had been urged or ordered to evacuate. Evacuations spanned 22 counties from the Florida Panhandle into north central Florida. But fears lingered that some failed to heed the calls to get out of Michael's way as the hard-charging storm began speeding north over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nWorried meteorologists said it had the potential of becoming one of the worst storms in the history of Florida's Panhandle.\n\n\"I guess it's the worst case scenario. I don't think anyone would have experienced this in the Panhandle,\" meteorologist Ryan Maue of weathermodels.com told The Associated Press. \"This is going to have structure damaging winds along the coast and hurricane force winds inland.\"\n\nUniversity of Georgia's Marshall Shepherd, a former president of the American Meteorological Society, called it a \"life-altering event\" on Facebook and said he watched the storm's growth on satellite images with a pit growing in his stomach.\n\nFranklin County Sheriff A.J. Smith near the vulnerable coast said his deputies had gone door to door in some places urging people to evacuate. \"We have done everything we can as far as getting the word out,\" Smith said. \"Hopefully more people will leave.\"\n\nOn the exposed coast of Florida's Big Bend, most of the waterfront homes in Keaton Beach stood vacant amid fears of a life-threatening storm surge in an area that hadn't seen a potentially catastrophic major hurricane in decades. Even so, 77-year-old resident Robert Sadousky wasn't quite ready to evacuate yet.\n\nThe retired mill worker has spent more than half his life on the coast and weathered his share of storms. He chose the spot where his house stands on tall stilts overlooking the Gulf waters in 1972 after it was the only lot left dry after a storm flooded the beach that year.\n\nWhile most homes around him are vacation rentals or summer getaways for their owners, Sadousky had stayed put through more than four decades of storms. No longer. Michael was expected to bring surging seas up 9 feet (2.75 meters) above ground level at Keaton Beach.\n\n\"I know it's going to cover everything around here,\" Sadousky said Tuesday, eyeing water lapping at the edge of a canal behind his home. He pulled two small boat docks from the water, packed his pickup and picked some beans from his garden before getting out -- like hundreds of thousands elsewhere.\n\nAt 11 p.m. Tuesday, the eye of Michael was about 220 miles (355 kilometers) south-southwest of Panama City, Florida. It also was about 200 miles (325 kilometers) south-southwest of Apalachicola, Florida. But forecasters said winds and outer rain bands of a storm that was strengthening and becoming better organized by the hour would begin lashing the coast well ahead of the eye making landfall.\n\nMore than 180,000 people of those leaving were under mandatory evacuation orders, the long lines of cars jamming routes out Tuesday.\n\n\"We don't know if it's going to wipe out our house or not,\" Jason McDonald, of Panama City, said as he and his wife drove north to safety into Alabama with their two children, ages 5 and 7. \"We want to get them out of the way.\"\n\nFlorida Gov. Rick Scott warned it was a \"monstrous hurricane,\" and his Democratic opponent for the Senate, Sen. Bill Nelson, said a \"wall of water\" could cause destruction along the Panhandle.\n\n\"Don't think that you can ride this out if you're in a low-lying area,\" Nelson said on CNN.\n\nBut some officials were worried by what they weren't seeing -- a rush of evacuees.\n\n\"I am not seeing the level of traffic on the roadways that I would expect when we've called for the evacuation of 75 percent of this county,\" Bay County Sheriff Tommy Ford said.\n\nIn the dangerously exposed coastal town of Apalachicola, population 2,500, Sally Crown planned to go home and hunker down with her two dogs.\n\n\"We've been through this before,\" she said. \"This might be really bad and serious. But in my experience, it's always blown way out of proportion.\"\n\nMandatory evacuation orders went into effect in Panama City Beach and other low-lying areas in the storm's path. That included Pensacola Beach but not in Pensacola itself, a city of about 54,000.\n\nMichael could dump up to a foot (30 centimeters) of rain over some Panhandle communities before its remnants go back out to sea by way of the mid-Atlantic states over the next few days. Forecasters said it also could bring 3 to 6 inches of rain to Georgia, the Carolinas and Virginia, triggering flash flooding in a corner of the country still recovering from Florence. And isolated tornadoes were also possible.\n\nLush reported from St. Petersburg, Florida.

Sorbe said the meeting was a valuable opportunity for Senate members to share their ideas with students involved in student government at other schools in the state.\n\n\"I think student federation is a good time for collaboration for student government associations across the state and to shoot ideas off of each other that we may be having and complications we might be having,\" Sorbe said. \"They are good people to bounce ideas off of because they are doing the same things we are doing just in different places.\"\n\nThe Board of Regents meeting covered a variety of topics including need-based financial aid, faculty salary competitiveness, Native American student enrollment and free speech policy revisions.\n\nSorbe said he found the first reading of the free speech policy an interesting point of discussion.\n\n\"They saw their first reading and it was approved to their second one where the Regents will most likely vote on the policy in December,\" Sorbe said. \"Outside of that, we also met South Dakota student federation out at Mines and there we discussed the Board of Regents priorities, which will be introduced in resolution from USD to student federation for all their agendas.\"\n\nSorbe and Green attended the meeting on behalf of USD, while the rest of the senators went on a volunteer basis. The Board of Regents meets every two months.\n\nSkunk said attending this meeting gave him an appreciation for USD's SGA.\n\n\"We should take pride in what we have as far as student government goes,\" Skunk said. \"If you look at the student federations at the School of Mines, their office is one room. We are very lucky here.\"\n\nAt this week's SGA meeting, the Senate relooked at five bills and one resolution. Three of the five bills were passed at this meeting. Senate Bill 78, which appropriates the budget for the Seldinger Society, Senate Bill 79, which approves the budget for the Philosophy club and Senate Bill 80 which appropriates the Math Club budget.\n\nThe other two bills, Senate Bill 76, which poses to change the SGA election dates and Senate Bill 77, which is on student organization recognition, will be brought back after going to internal reviews for the next meeting.\n\nSenate Resolution 6, which poses to change the MUC hours back to 2 a.m., was discussed and voted on, but it did not pass. Besides the discussion for this resolution, special guest Dan Dailey, Dean of Libraries, also addressed the Muenster University Center hours.\n\nDailey distributed a document of facts for the Senate to look at while he spoke. According to the document, I.D. Weeks Library originally began staying open till 2 a.m. in 2010. The dean of libraries and staff reviewed the policy again in 2014 and saw that there was the low utilization of the library, but decided to keep the policy as is.\n\nBefore the hour's change was made this school year, there was a thorough review of the current hours. Data was collected on the number of student present after midnight along with the use of computers after midnight.\n\n\"A very small fraction of those entries into I.D. Weeks happen after midnight during the weeknights,\" Daily said. \"I asked our staff to look at the utilization of I.D. Weeks after midnight, we dug into the statistics in 2017 and 2018.

In other words, there's a meaning, there's a definition, there's a reason,\" he said. \"The reason behind this run is simply first and foremost personal greatness, personal achievement but also what I can bring awareness to, what I can raise money for,\" he continued before shouting, \"Education!\"\n\nOTHER NEWS YOU MIGHT HAVE MISSED: Blac Chyna A SlutWalk No-show (She & Amber UNfollow Each Other)\n\nKevin also shared a video after crossing the finish line Sunday, and even though he was disappointed in his time, he was happy he participated.\n\nAs reported by The Blast, Hart, who finished 18,057 with a time of 4:13:10, says he broke down hard at mile 22 with cramps that felt like \"Someone shot me in my ass, calf, and hamstring.\"\n\nHe said sh*t got real when he \"Saw two older women sh*t on themselves,\" including one woman who popped a squat in front of everyone and just \"Moved her shorts to the side.\"\n\nWatch him explain it via the clip above.\n\nMeanwhile, reviews have been largely negative for his latest movie \"Night School\" but for Kevin, it's the fan's opinions that matter most, as he recently explained:\n\n\"It's been so positive from the fans.

Well, he's in that space again because the man who says he was assaulted by Williams last Friday in Portland is suing the funnyman for $76,000.\n\nHis lawyer says the money is for his physical injuries and emotional distress. The alleged victim's name is Wali Kanani and he's the owner of Delta Town Car Service in Portland.\n\nKanani was picking up Williams, his German Shepherd, and his colleagues at a private hanger of the airport, reports Fox12.\n\nThe complaint, filed Monday, states Williams insisted his dog sit in the front seat, and Kanani said no.\n\nThe document outlines what happened from there. It alleges Williams called Kanani names like \"white trash,\" then punched him in the face.\n\nKanani ran inside to get away and Williams reportedly \"commanded his dog to start chasing\" him, according to court documents.\n\n\"This is totally inappropriate behavior and there has to be some sort of deterrent effect above and beyond what the lawsuit itself would bring,\" Kanani's attorney Adam Heder said.\n\nThat's why Heder filed the complaint now asking for $76,000 plus medical costs.\n\nREAD THIS/BLIND ITEM: HIS 'GIRLFRIEND' IS PRETTY MUCH AN AFTERTHOUGHT\n\nThe article goes on to say that Attorney Heder wouldn't provide photos of Kanani's injuries, but said he had cuts and swelling on his face, a broken tooth and tinnitus in one ear, as well as what he's suffered emotionally.\n\n\"You can imagine in the course of doing your job getting struck in the face in this aggressive and belligerent manner can cause a tremendous amount of emotional distress to even the best of us,\" Heder said.\n\nAs far as what's happening with Williams in court, on Monday he had a hearing on the charge of assault in the fourth degree. The judge apparently wasn't impressed and he was released on that charge. However, the judge ordered him to stay away from Kanani (but now Kanani is suing him).\n\nSo, even though Williams doesn't have to worry about that charge, as we've reported, he's is still in lockdown in Portland because he's wanted in Georgia","source":{"uri":"eurweb.com","dataType":"news","title":"EURweb"},"authors":[],"eventUri":null,"location":null},{"uri":"965790367","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2018-10-10","time":"05:19:00","dateTime":"2018-10-10T05:19:00Z","dataType":"news","sim":0.6313725709915161,"url":"https://www.mediaite.com/tv/don-lemon-people-harassing-ted-cruz-at-restaurant-wasnt-mob-behavior-its-people-who-are-upset/","title":"Don Lemon: People Harassing Ted Cruz at Restaurant Wasn't 'Mob Behavior,' It's 'People Who Are Upset'","body":"CNN host Don Lemon took a similar stance with his colleague Brooke Baldwin about what defines a mob.\n\nEarlier in the day, Daily Beast columnist Matt Lewis argued that the anti-Kavanaugh protestors who harassed Sen.

Dall'Imis al fondo perequativo, dai nidi al trasporto pubblico, in assenza di informazioni abbiamo dovuto confermare i numeri dell'anno scorso\".\n\nLa proposta di bilancio completa sarà depositata il 15 novembre, un mese prima della discussione in aula.\n\nCome avviene ormai da svariati anni, tutti i Servizi comunali sono stati invitati a ridurre la spesa corrente e a calibrare bene le previsioni, in modo da non generare avanzo. Per quanto riguarda i contenuti della manovra, il sindaco ha sottolineato l'invarianza delle tariffe (\"al massimo ci sarà un adeguamento al tasso di inflazione programmata\"), l'aumento delle risorse per i lavori socialmente utili e per il turismo: \"E' un settore che tira - ha spiegato Andreatta - Quest'anno poi è andato particolarmente bene grazie alla concentrazione di grandi eventi ospitati in città\".\n\nMassima attenzione anche al sociale, con l'aumento (costante in questi anni) delle voci per l'integrazione dell'affitto e per supportare le famiglie più fragili. Naturalmente in primo piano resta anche il capitolo sicurezza, che prevede tra l'altro la sostituzione di tutti gli agenti che andranno in pensione e il rafforzamento della squadra aggiuntiva della polizia municipale, che diventa stabile e non più a termine come ai suoi esordi.\n\nTra i temi del confronto, pure il bando Periferie e il nodo dei 18 milioni di euro prima confermati e poi messi in dubbio dal governo nazionale: \"Pare che i fondi non ci siano stati tolti, ma siano stati posticipati al 2020 - ha spiegato l'assessore Gilmozzi - Se le risorse non arrivassero, ai Comuni è stata data la possibilità di utilizzare l'avanzo di bilancio. Non che la cosa ci faccia piacere, perché l'avanzo sono soldi nostri, non dello Stato\".\n\nL'assessore Gilmozzi si è soffermato anche sugli investimenti dei prossimi anni: dal restyling di piazza della Mostra alla nuova piscina, dal recupero dell'ex Atesina a quello dell'ex facoltà di Lettere, dal nuovo quartiere in viale dei Tigli ai numerosi interventi di manutenzione sul patrimonio edilizio esistente.\n\nI sindacati hanno invitato l'Amministrazione comunale a mantenere alta l'attenzione sulla sicurezza e sulla percezione della sicurezza da parte dei cittadini (Pomini) e sulle politiche di conciliazione per favorire il lavoro delle donne (Grosselli). Alotti ha sollecitato il sindaco ad aumentare la tassazione sulle case sfitte. E ancora Grosselli ha chiesto di mirare non solo alla riduzione dei costi ma anche alla tutela del lavoro negli appalti di servizi.","source":{"uri":"lavocedeltrentino.it","dataType":"news","title":"La Voce del Trentino Quotidiano online INDIPENDENTE"},"authors":[],"eventUri":null,"location":null},{"uri":"965790374","lang":"ita","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2018-10-10","time":"05:19:00","dateTime":"2018-10-10T05:19:00Z","dataType":"news","sim":0,"url":"https://www.lavocedeltrentino.it/2018/10/10/concluso-nel-migliore-dei-modi-lo-street-food-festival-levento-che-unisce-la-comunita-e-colora-le-strade/","title":"Concluso nel migliore dei modi lo Street Food Festival, l'evento che unisce la comunità e colora le strade - La voce del Trentino","body":"Si è conclusa domenica la terza edizione dello Street Food Festival, l'evento ha colorato le strade della città che, come sempre, sono state riempite dai profumi più disparati ed intriganti.\n\nSolo qualche giorno fa è stato celebrato un altro importante appuntamento, il Mercato Europeo.

The rest is not yet history as Gary Johnson, a former governor of New Mexico, seeks a seat in the U.S. Senate as a Libertarian and political wild card.\n\nJohnson says his high-desert home state of 2 million residents stands to gain considerable influence in the Senate if he is elected as a freewheeling swing vote -- possibly a decisive vote in the chamber, as Republicans defend a slim 51-49 majority in November elections.\n\nDemocrats are being forced to defend what had seemed like a secure seat for incumbent first-term Sen. Martin Heinrich, fending off Johnson's allure among voters as an uncompromising fiscal conservative with a quirky brand of free-market, pro-cannabis policies.\n\n\"Arguably if elected I would be the swing vote in the U.S. Senate, and that would be a big yank for New Mexico. It should benefit New Mexico in a really big way,\" Johnson tells a crowd of two dozen at a candidate forum in Tucumcari, near a string of abandoned highway-side motels, on the state's rural eastern plains.\n\nNationwide, Democrats are defending 26 incumbent Senate seats, while Republicans are defending only nine. The stakes in fall Senate races have been on dramatic display in Supreme Court confirmation proceedings amid accusations of sexual misconduct against nominee Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nJohnson says he would be a voice of common sense in the Senate and a rare nonpartisan vote during Supreme Court confirmation proceedings -- and an impartial judge in the event of a Senate impeachment trial against President Donald Trump, though he sees no impeachable offense so far.\n\nUntil then, Johnson applauds Trump's work at diminishing regulations, and denounces White House immigration policies as shameful and bad for the economy.\n\nThe real political crisis and looming threat to America's wellbeing, Johnson says, is runaway deficit spending. And the day of reckoning will come, according to Johnson, in the form of Venezuela-style inflation if the U.S. continues to spend beyond its means, on military and social programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.\n\n\"I applaud Trump on the tax cuts, but where is the spending reduction to go along with that,\" said Johnson, who wants to join the Senate Budget Committee that sets out Congress' broad blueprint for levels of federal revenues and spending.\n\nProminent Democrats say Johnson can't barge his way onto the committee, and they suspect he would readily collaborate to torpedo federal health care and nutritional subsidies that New Mexico relies on heavily.\n\nDede Feldman, a Democratic political strategist who served in the state Senate when Johnson was governor, questions Johnson's credentials as a voice of moderation, noting he was held in contempt as governor by the New Mexico Supreme Court for persisting with aggressive welfare changes without legislative approval.\n\nAt a community bank in Tucumcari, Johnson finds a receptive audience for his criticism of burdensome federal financial regulation in a meeting with the board of directors -- and some astonishment at his calls to decrease military spending by 23 percent, cut Medicare and retool Social Security.\n\n\"I'm 80 years old. I'm on Medicare, I receive Social Security, and I'm retired from the military,\" said Bill Curry, a board member at the Tucumcari Federal Savings and Loan Association, which was founded during the 1930s Great Depression. \"You've hit me on four different things.\"\n\nJohnson doesn't back down, cautioning social and retirement programs won't be around for future generations without prompt action.\n\nHe derides as a budget-buster his opponent Heinrich's support of \"Medicare-for-all\" legislation aimed at making strides toward universal health insurance coverage.\n\nHeinrich has cast himself as a defender of federal health and retirement benefits, and proponent of the new outdoor-recreation and renewable-energy economies -- a progressive hedge in an oil-based state economy.\n\nHeinrich, with youthful looks at age 46, has turned his committee appointments, including Armed Services, into a venue for expedient constituent politics in support of the New Mexico's military facilities and veterans.\n\nJohnson's answer to escalating medical costs is less regulation and even easing licensing requirement for medical professionals. His faith in free-market solutions with less regulation spills over into everything from oilfield methane emissions to public education, where Johnson supports government spending on independent schools through vouchers.\n\nPollsters and analysts see obstacles to Johnson building a quick coalition, after his late entry to the race in August.\n\n\"There are a lot of unaffiliated registered voters, but they tend to vote in half their numbers on low-turnout elections,\" said pollster Brian Sanderoff, of Research & Polling in Albuquerque. \"They're less likely to vote in nonpresidential election cycles.\"\n\nNew Mexico's Republican Party is calling Johnson a spoiler, saying he will draw votes from their candidate -- construction contractor and political newcomer Mick Rich -- playing directly into Democrats' hands.\n\nJohnson dismisses the GOP as a lost cause this year in New Mexico, which sided with Hillary Clinton in 2016 by a wide margin and twice backed Barack Obama.\n\n\"I do not think that a Republican can win a statewide race in New Mexico. I think that Trump has polluted those chances,\" he said.\n\nAs a Republican governor, Johnson vetoed more than 700 bills in perpetual standoffs with a Legislature run by Democrats, vetoing the entire budget in his final year only to have legislators override him. His advocacy as governor for marijuana legalization, beginning in 1999 when the stance was unpopular, still provides a political calling card -- one that Johnson says speaks to his honesty regardless of political consequences.\n\nCampaign disclosure filings show Johnson also is an investor in the nascent legal marijuana sector and a professional adviser to a cannabis hedge fund. He is a recreational user himself -- in a state that regulates medical marijuana access but still penalizes recreational cannabis.\n\nHeinrich, the Democrat, recently threw his support behind legalizing marijuana, while Johnson already is contemplating how to provide pardons for legions of drug-possession convicts.\n\nFor Johnson, a third act in politics at age 65 would mean setting aside a lifestyle of 100-day winter ski seasons and summer endurance bicycle rallies along the Continental Divide. Barnstorming through tiny towns to shake hands and deliver yard signs, Johnson said Trump has created the perfect storm for a Libertarian or truly independent candidate to join Congress and broker majority votes -- calling Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Angus King of Maine independents in name only.\n\nStopping unannounced at a barbecue stand at midday, Johnson ignites flickers of recognition and then conversations that often turn to his thoughts on cannabis.\n\n\"I love his policies,\" said Jace Alderson, 61, of Moriarty, recalling Johnson's hard-line stance against government spending as a Republican governor. \"It doesn't matter what party he is.\"","source":{"uri":"wral.com","dataType":"news","title":"WRAL.com"},"authors":[],"eventUri":null,"location":{"type":"place","label":{"eng":"Tucumcari, New Mexico"},"lat":35.17191,"long":-103.72686,"country":{"type":"country","label":{"eng":"United States"},"lat":39.76,"long":-98.5}}},{"uri":"965790356","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2018-10-10","time":"05:19:00","dateTime":"2018-10-10T05:19:00Z","dataType":"news","sim":0.6901960968971252,"url":"https://www.eurweb.com/2018/10/antonio-brown-sued-for-throwing-furniture-from-balcony-that-nearly-killed-toddler/","title":"Antonio Brown Sued for Throwing Furniture From Balcony That Nearly Killed Toddler","body":"According to TMZ, Brown snapped back in April and threw a bunch of furniture off the balcony of his 14th story luxury apartment, and some of it shattered near a 22-month-old baby.\n\nA lawsuit obtained by TMZ Sports states Antonio is being sued by Ophir Sternberg -- who claims it was his toddler son who was walking around the pool at the apartment complex with his grandfather when suddenly \"large objects started to fall from the building many floors above them.\"\n\nOTHER NEWS YOU MIGHT HAVE MISSED: Kanye West and Donald Trump Have a Lunch Date at the White House\n\nSternberg claims the items included: 2 very large vases, a heavy ottoman and other pieces of furniture.

Around midday it was expected to become one of the Panhandle's worst hurricanes in memory with 125 mph winds and a life-threatening storm surge of up to 13 feet (4 meters).\n\nFlorida officials said roughly 375,000 people up and down the Gulf Coast had been urged or ordered to evacuate. Evacuations spanned 22 counties from the Florida Panhandle into north central Florida. But fears lingered that some failed to heed the calls to get out of Michael's way as the hard-charging storm began speeding north over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nWorried meteorologists said it had the potential of becoming one of the worst storms in the history of Florida's Panhandle.\n\n\"I guess it's the worst case scenario. I don't think anyone would have experienced this in the Panhandle,\" meteorologist Ryan Maue of weathermodels.com told The Associated Press. \"This is going to have structure damaging winds along the coast and hurricane force winds inland.\"\n\nUniversity of Georgia's Marshall Shepherd, a former president of the American Meteorological Society, called it a \"life-altering event\" on Facebook and said he watched the storm's growth on satellite images with a pit growing in his stomach.\n\nFranklin County Sheriff A.J. Smith near the vulnerable coast said his deputies had gone door to door in some places urging people to evacuate. \"We have done everything we can as far as getting the word out,\" Smith said. \"Hopefully more people will leave.\"\n\nOn the exposed coast of Florida's Big Bend, most of the waterfront homes in Keaton Beach stood vacant amid fears of a life-threatening storm surge in an area that hadn't seen a potentially catastrophic major hurricane in decades. Even so, 77-year-old resident Robert Sadousky wasn't quite ready to evacuate yet.\n\nThe retired mill worker has spent more than half his life on the coast and weathered his share of storms. He chose the spot where his house stands on tall stilts overlooking the Gulf waters in 1972 after it was the only lot left dry after a storm flooded the beach that year.\n\nWhile most homes around him are vacation rentals or summer getaways for their owners, Sadousky had stayed put through more than four decades of storms. No longer. Michael was expected to bring surging seas up 9 feet (2.75 meters) above ground level at Keaton Beach.\n\n\"I know it's going to cover everything around here,\" Sadousky said Tuesday, eyeing water lapping at the edge of a canal behind his home. He pulled two small boat docks from the water, packed his pickup and picked some beans from his garden before getting out -- like hundreds of thousands elsewhere.\n\nAt 11 p.m. Tuesday, the eye of Michael was about 220 miles (355 kilometers) south-southwest of Panama City, Florida. It also was about 200 miles (325 kilometers) south-southwest of Apalachicola, Florida. But forecasters said winds and outer rain bands of a storm that was strengthening and becoming better organized by the hour would begin lashing the coast well ahead of the eye making landfall.\n\nMore than 180,000 people of those leaving were under mandatory evacuation orders, the long lines of cars jamming routes out Tuesday.\n\n\"We don't know if it's going to wipe out our house or not,\" Jason McDonald, of Panama City, said as he and his wife drove north to safety into Alabama with their two children, ages 5 and 7. \"We want to get them out of the way.\"\n\nFlorida Gov. Rick Scott warned it was a \"monstrous hurricane,\" and his Democratic opponent for the Senate, Sen. Bill Nelson, said a \"wall of water\" could cause destruction along the Panhandle.\n\n\"Don't think that you can ride this out if you're in a low-lying area,\" Nelson said on CNN.\n\nBut some officials were worried by what they weren't seeing -- a rush of evacuees.\n\n\"I am not seeing the level of traffic on the roadways that I would expect when we've called for the evacuation of 75 percent of this county,\" Bay County Sheriff Tommy Ford said.\n\nIn the dangerously exposed coastal town of Apalachicola, population 2,500, Sally Crown planned to go home and hunker down with her two dogs.\n\n\"We've been through this before,\" she said. \"This might be really bad and serious. But in my experience, it's always blown way out of proportion.\"\n\nMandatory evacuation orders went into effect in Panama City Beach and other low-lying areas in the storm's path. That included Pensacola Beach but not in Pensacola itself, a city of about 54,000.\n\nMichael could dump up to a foot (30 centimeters) of rain over some Panhandle communities before its remnants go back out to sea by way of the mid-Atlantic states over the next few days. Forecasters said it also could bring 3 to 6 inches of rain to Georgia, the Carolinas and Virginia, triggering flash flooding in a corner of the country still recovering from Florence. And isolated tornadoes were also possible.\n\nLush reported from St. Petersburg, Florida.

Sorbe said the meeting was a valuable opportunity for Senate members to share their ideas with students involved in student government at other schools in the state.\n\n\"I think student federation is a good time for collaboration for student government associations across the state and to shoot ideas off of each other that we may be having and complications we might be having,\" Sorbe said. \"They are good people to bounce ideas off of because they are doing the same things we are doing just in different places.\"\n\nThe Board of Regents meeting covered a variety of topics including need-based financial aid, faculty salary competitiveness, Native American student enrollment and free speech policy revisions.\n\nSorbe said he found the first reading of the free speech policy an interesting point of discussion.\n\n\"They saw their first reading and it was approved to their second one where the Regents will most likely vote on the policy in December,\" Sorbe said. \"Outside of that, we also met South Dakota student federation out at Mines and there we discussed the Board of Regents priorities, which will be introduced in resolution from USD to student federation for all their agendas.\"\n\nSorbe and Green attended the meeting on behalf of USD, while the rest of the senators went on a volunteer basis. The Board of Regents meets every two months.\n\nSkunk said attending this meeting gave him an appreciation for USD's SGA.\n\n\"We should take pride in what we have as far as student government goes,\" Skunk said. \"If you look at the student federations at the School of Mines, their office is one room. We are very lucky here.\"\n\nAt this week's SGA meeting, the Senate relooked at five bills and one resolution. Three of the five bills were passed at this meeting. Senate Bill 78, which appropriates the budget for the Seldinger Society, Senate Bill 79, which approves the budget for the Philosophy club and Senate Bill 80 which appropriates the Math Club budget.\n\nThe other two bills, Senate Bill 76, which poses to change the SGA election dates and Senate Bill 77, which is on student organization recognition, will be brought back after going to internal reviews for the next meeting.\n\nSenate Resolution 6, which poses to change the MUC hours back to 2 a.m., was discussed and voted on, but it did not pass. Besides the discussion for this resolution, special guest Dan Dailey, Dean of Libraries, also addressed the Muenster University Center hours.\n\nDailey distributed a document of facts for the Senate to look at while he spoke. According to the document, I.D. Weeks Library originally began staying open till 2 a.m. in 2010. The dean of libraries and staff reviewed the policy again in 2014 and saw that there was the low utilization of the library, but decided to keep the policy as is.\n\nBefore the hour's change was made this school year, there was a thorough review of the current hours. Data was collected on the number of student present after midnight along with the use of computers after midnight.\n\n\"A very small fraction of those entries into I.D. Weeks happen after midnight during the weeknights,\" Daily said. \"I asked our staff to look at the utilization of I.D. Weeks after midnight, we dug into the statistics in 2017 and 2018.

Well, he's in that space again because the man who says he was assaulted by Williams last Friday in Portland is suing the funnyman for $76,000.\n\nHis lawyer says the money is for his physical injuries and emotional distress. The alleged victim's name is Wali Kanani and he's the owner of Delta Town Car Service in Portland.\n\nKanani was picking up Williams, his German Shepherd, and his colleagues at a private hanger of the airport, reports Fox12.\n\nThe complaint, filed Monday, states Williams insisted his dog sit in the front seat, and Kanani said no.\n\nThe document outlines what happened from there. It alleges Williams called Kanani names like \"white trash,\" then punched him in the face.\n\nKanani ran inside to get away and Williams reportedly \"commanded his dog to start chasing\" him, according to court documents.\n\n\"This is totally inappropriate behavior and there has to be some sort of deterrent effect above and beyond what the lawsuit itself would bring,\" Kanani's attorney Adam Heder said.\n\nThat's why Heder filed the complaint now asking for $76,000 plus medical costs.\n\nREAD THIS/BLIND ITEM: HIS 'GIRLFRIEND' IS PRETTY MUCH AN AFTERTHOUGHT\n\nThe article goes on to say that Attorney Heder wouldn't provide photos of Kanani's injuries, but said he had cuts and swelling on his face, a broken tooth and tinnitus in one ear, as well as what he's suffered emotionally.\n\n\"You can imagine in the course of doing your job getting struck in the face in this aggressive and belligerent manner can cause a tremendous amount of emotional distress to even the best of us,\" Heder said.\n\nAs far as what's happening with Williams in court, on Monday he had a hearing on the charge of assault in the fourth degree. The judge apparently wasn't impressed and he was released on that charge. However, the judge ordered him to stay away from Kanani (but now Kanani is suing him).\n\nSo, even though Williams doesn't have to worry about that charge, as we've reported, he's is still in lockdown in Portland because he's wanted in Georgia","source":{"uri":"eurweb.com","dataType":"news","title":"EURweb"},"authors":[],"eventUri":null,"location":null},{"uri":"965790367","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2018-10-10","time":"05:19:00","dateTime":"2018-10-10T05:19:00Z","dataType":"news","sim":0.6313725709915161,"url":"https://www.mediaite.com/tv/don-lemon-people-harassing-ted-cruz-at-restaurant-wasnt-mob-behavior-its-people-who-are-upset/","title":"Don Lemon: People Harassing Ted Cruz at Restaurant Wasn't 'Mob Behavior,' It's 'People Who Are Upset'","body":"CNN host Don Lemon took a similar stance with his colleague Brooke Baldwin about what defines a mob.\n\nEarlier in the day, Daily Beast columnist Matt Lewis argued that the anti-Kavanaugh protestors who harassed Sen.

Dall'Imis al fondo perequativo, dai nidi al trasporto pubblico, in assenza di informazioni abbiamo dovuto confermare i numeri dell'anno scorso\".\n\nLa proposta di bilancio completa sarà depositata il 15 novembre, un mese prima della discussione in aula.\n\nCome avviene ormai da svariati anni, tutti i Servizi comunali sono stati invitati a ridurre la spesa corrente e a calibrare bene le previsioni, in modo da non generare avanzo. Per quanto riguarda i contenuti della manovra, il sindaco ha sottolineato l'invarianza delle tariffe (\"al massimo ci sarà un adeguamento al tasso di inflazione programmata\"), l'aumento delle risorse per i lavori socialmente utili e per il turismo: \"E' un settore che tira - ha spiegato Andreatta - Quest'anno poi è andato particolarmente bene grazie alla concentrazione di grandi eventi ospitati in città\".\n\nMassima attenzione anche al sociale, con l'aumento (costante in questi anni) delle voci per l'integrazione dell'affitto e per supportare le famiglie più fragili. Naturalmente in primo piano resta anche il capitolo sicurezza, che prevede tra l'altro la sostituzione di tutti gli agenti che andranno in pensione e il rafforzamento della squadra aggiuntiva della polizia municipale, che diventa stabile e non più a termine come ai suoi esordi.\n\nTra i temi del confronto, pure il bando Periferie e il nodo dei 18 milioni di euro prima confermati e poi messi in dubbio dal governo nazionale: \"Pare che i fondi non ci siano stati tolti, ma siano stati posticipati al 2020 - ha spiegato l'assessore Gilmozzi - Se le risorse non arrivassero, ai Comuni è stata data la possibilità di utilizzare l'avanzo di bilancio. Non che la cosa ci faccia piacere, perché l'avanzo sono soldi nostri, non dello Stato\".\n\nL'assessore Gilmozzi si è soffermato anche sugli investimenti dei prossimi anni: dal restyling di piazza della Mostra alla nuova piscina, dal recupero dell'ex Atesina a quello dell'ex facoltà di Lettere, dal nuovo quartiere in viale dei Tigli ai numerosi interventi di manutenzione sul patrimonio edilizio esistente.\n\nI sindacati hanno invitato l'Amministrazione comunale a mantenere alta l'attenzione sulla sicurezza e sulla percezione della sicurezza da parte dei cittadini (Pomini) e sulle politiche di conciliazione per favorire il lavoro delle donne (Grosselli). Alotti ha sollecitato il sindaco ad aumentare la tassazione sulle case sfitte. E ancora Grosselli ha chiesto di mirare non solo alla riduzione dei costi ma anche alla tutela del lavoro negli appalti di servizi.","source":{"uri":"lavocedeltrentino.it","dataType":"news","title":"La Voce del Trentino Quotidiano online INDIPENDENTE"},"authors":[],"eventUri":null,"location":null},{"uri":"965790374","lang":"ita","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2018-10-10","time":"05:19:00","dateTime":"2018-10-10T05:19:00Z","dataType":"news","sim":0,"url":"https://www.lavocedeltrentino.it/2018/10/10/concluso-nel-migliore-dei-modi-lo-street-food-festival-levento-che-unisce-la-comunita-e-colora-le-strade/","title":"Concluso nel migliore dei modi lo Street Food Festival, l'evento che unisce la comunità e colora le strade - La voce del Trentino","body":"Si è conclusa domenica la terza edizione dello Street Food Festival, l'evento ha colorato le strade della città che, come sempre, sono state riempite dai profumi più disparati ed intriganti.\n\nSolo qualche giorno fa è stato celebrato un altro importante appuntamento, il Mercato Europeo. Anche qui, il cibo è stato l'assoluto protagonista dell'iniziativa che ha contato un significativo numero di visitatori.\n\nSapori italiani, sapori internazionali ed esotici hanno quindi conquistato la cittadinanza in un susseguirsi di appuntamenti \"appetitosi\".\n\nI truck che sono accorsi allo Street Food Festival, occupando il centro storico di Rovereto, si sono dimostrati dei veri e propri \"intrattenitori\", esponevano, oltre alle ricercate pietanze, la cultura del luogo che rappresentavano e questo, non può che considerarsi un valore aggiunto per una città che sta diventando sempre più all'avanguardia e internazionale.\n\nLa nascita dello street food (cibo da strada) risale a tempi antichissimi e, ancora oggi, è considerata una pratica di socializzazione, un momento di svago che ricorda il passato e la bellezza dello \"stare in paese\".\n\nAd aderire a questa edizione più di 20 furgoncini d'annata restaurati e colorati. Hanno partecipato Toscana, Veneto, Lazio, Calabria, Marche, Lombardia e molte altre regioni, ma, anche questa volta, i sapori esteri non potevano mancare; intramontabili i truck messicani, spagnoli e venezuelani.\n\nL' evento non si è però scemato dopo l'ora di cena. Durante queste giornate di festa, alcuni momenti sono stati vivacizzati da animazione con musica, attività, giochi per bambini, spettacoli di danza ed esibizioni con i tessuti aerei.\n\n\"Veniamo spesso con gli amici al food festival-spiegano degli studenti roveretani-, è una sorta di appuntamento fisso. Ci piace sperimentare nuovi sapori e siamo felici di poter vivere, anche di sera, la città in questo modo\".\n\nMolto soddisfatti anche gli stessi venditori, \"Rovereto è una città che ha molto da offrire, ci piace questo clima. Alcuni di noi vengono da grandi città, altri da piccole. Qui ci sentiamo accolti. L'organizzazione è stata ottima, ci stiamo godendo il più possibile questa esperienza. Vediamo che anche le persone sono soddisfatte, ne siamo felici\". Spiegano al \"Gnoc e Lambrosc truck food\" di Reggio Emilia.\n\n\"Siamo soddisfatti - hanno affermano all' \"Happy Train\" di Monte Pulciano- c'è stata una buona organizzazione, ci siamo trovati bene e lavoriamo con piacere qui\".\n\nPuò dirsi quindi felicemente concluso uno degli eventi più apprezzati dalla cittadinanza, la speranza è quella di rivedere presto i coloratissimi e profumati truck.","source":{"uri":"lavocedeltrentino.it","dataType":"news","title":"La Voce del Trentino Quotidiano online INDIPENDENTE"},"authors":[{"uri":"eleonora_postai@lavocedeltrentino.it","name":"Eleonora Postai","type":"author","isAgency":false}],"eventUri":null,"location":null}
